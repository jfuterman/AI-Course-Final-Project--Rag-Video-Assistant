00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,709

now we now introduce the core algorith

2
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:09,719
now we now introduce the core algorith
 

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,509
now we now introduce the core algorith
for this uh section this lecture which

4
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:13,519
for this uh section this lecture which
 

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,390
for this uh section this lecture which
is uh the base filter and I'm going to

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,400
is uh the base filter and I'm going to
 

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,390
is uh the base filter and I'm going to
write the algorith in a form of a kind

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:18,400
write the algorith in a form of a kind
 

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,070
write the algorith in a form of a kind
of a python function um the uh algorith

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,080
of a python function um the uh algorith
 

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,950
of a python function um the uh algorith
is um going is um this the

12
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:26,960
is um going is um this the
 

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,790
is um going is um this the
base let's say underscore filter it has

14
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
base let's say underscore filter it has
 

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,310
base let's say underscore filter it has
uh three arguments the first argument is

16
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,320
uh three arguments the first argument is
 

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,790
uh three arguments the first argument is
the

18
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:35,800
the
 

19
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,910
the
belief of where we are we in the

20
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:38,920
belief of where we are we in the
 

21
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,750
belief of where we are we in the
previous time instance St minus one and

22
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:42,760
previous time instance St minus one and
 

23
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,110
previous time instance St minus one and
this is EV you know evidently the

24
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:46,120
this is EV you know evidently the
 

25
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,709
this is EV you know evidently the
posterior uh belief or posterior

26
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:48,719
posterior uh belief or posterior
 

27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,790
posterior uh belief or posterior
probability of what we are in the

28
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:50,800
probability of what we are in the
 

29
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,590
probability of what we are in the
previous state um so what what was our

30
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:54,600
previous state um so what what was our
 

31
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,869
previous state um so what what was our
previous state was and then the other

32
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
previous state was and then the other
 

33
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,229
previous state was and then the other
one argument is this action that we take

34
00:00:59,229 --> 00:00:59,239
one argument is this action that we take
 

35
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,709
one argument is this action that we take
at this point in time T and the

36
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:01,719
at this point in time T and the
 

37
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,189
at this point in time T and the
measurement ZT okay so these are the

38
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:04,199
measurement ZT okay so these are the
 

39
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:04,990
measurement ZT okay so these are the
three

40
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:05,000
three
 

41
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,310
three
arguments and uh there is a kind of a

42
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,320
arguments and uh there is a kind of a
 

43
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,590
arguments and uh there is a kind of a
for Loop uh we expect to see a for Loop

44
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:10,600
for Loop uh we expect to see a for Loop
 

45
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,310
for Loop uh we expect to see a for Loop
because as we said the discussion the

46
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,320
because as we said the discussion the
 

47
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,910
because as we said the discussion the
the algorith is um going to be

48
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:16,920
the algorith is um going to be
 

49
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,990
the algorith is um going to be
recursive so for all STS for all the

50
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:21,000
recursive so for all STS for all the
 

51
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,950
recursive so for all STS for all the
states

52
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:21,960
states
 

53
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,870
states
STS uh first we are

54
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:24,880
STS uh first we are
 

55
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,630
STS uh first we are
estimating the belief hatut of that

56
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:28,640
estimating the belief hatut of that
 

57
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,390
estimating the belief hatut of that
state

58
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:30,400
state
 

59
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,749
state
uh because we are going

60
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:32,759
uh because we are going
 

61
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,590
uh because we are going
to uh execute an

62
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:35,600
to uh execute an
 

63
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,069
to uh execute an
action and uh for that action that we

64
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:38,079
action and uh for that action that we
 

65
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,789
action and uh for that action that we
are

66
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:38,799
are
 

67
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,469
are
executing we are uh effectively going to

68
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:43,479
executing we are uh effectively going to
 

69
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,590
executing we are uh effectively going to
uh create a posterior that we will

70
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
uh create a posterior that we will
 

71
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,109
uh create a posterior that we will
effectively

72
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:47,119
effectively
 

73
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,670
effectively
integrate uh the um all the

74
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:50,680
integrate uh the um all the
 

75
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,230
integrate uh the um all the
possibilities almost like the

76
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,240
possibilities almost like the
 

77
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,709
possibilities almost like the
convolution or some

78
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,719
convolution or some
 

79
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,469
convolution or some
rule okay so let's let me write it down

80
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479

 

81
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,749

this is St given St minus one this is my

82
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:07,759
this is St given St minus one this is my
 

83
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,830
this is St given St minus one this is my
uh transitional model if you remember

84
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:09,840
uh transitional model if you remember
 

85
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,030
uh transitional model if you remember
from

86
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,040
from
 

87
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,309
from
earlier and uh this is the belief of St

88
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:15,319
earlier and uh this is the belief of St
 

89
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:18,990
earlier and uh this is the belief of St
minus one this is the incoming

90
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,000
minus one this is the incoming
 

91
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,910
minus one this is the incoming
belief where I believe I was uh before

92
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:22,920
belief where I believe I was uh before
 

93
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,470
belief where I believe I was uh before
and I use where sometimes in this

94
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,480
and I use where sometimes in this
 

95
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,830
and I use where sometimes in this
discussion because in the back of my

96
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:25,840
discussion because in the back of my
 

97
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,869
discussion because in the back of my
mind sometimes I have this simple

98
00:02:27,869 --> 00:02:27,879
mind sometimes I have this simple
 

99
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:30,550
mind sometimes I have this simple
localization kind of uh uh sort of use

100
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:30,560
localization kind of uh uh sort of use
 

101
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,190

00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,200
case but please replace the wear with uh
 

103
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,990

what was my previous state and okay so

104
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,000
what was my previous state and okay so
 

105
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,190
what was my previous state and okay so
uh that is uh uh basically the first

106
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,200
uh that is uh uh basically the first
 

107
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,110
uh that is uh uh basically the first
Formula we'll actually draw it a little

108
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,120
Formula we'll actually draw it a little
 

109
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,190
Formula we'll actually draw it a little
bit to see exactly what is what is going

110
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
bit to see exactly what is what is going
 

111
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,270
bit to see exactly what is what is going
going on a bit later and then the second

112
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:48,280
going on a bit later and then the second
 

113
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,070
going on a bit later and then the second
part the second part of the algorith is

114
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:51,080
part the second part of the algorith is
 

115
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,949
part the second part of the algorith is
now that I have the belief had I will do

116
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:53,959
now that I have the belief had I will do
 

117
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,350
now that I have the belief had I will do
the so-called uh measurement

118
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:56,360
the so-called uh measurement
 

119
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,509
the so-called uh measurement
update uh this is also known as um

120
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:02,519

 

121
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,710

prediction prediction

122
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:04,720

step and this is

124
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,000
step and this is
 

125
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,550
step and this is
the uh

126
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:12,560

 

127
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,630

measurement update step the prediction

128
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:15,640
measurement update step the prediction
 

129
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,430
measurement update step the prediction
step is kind of blind we are not

130
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:18,440
step is kind of blind we are not
 

131
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,190
step is kind of blind we are not
considering any measurement and uh as we

132
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,200
considering any measurement and uh as we
 

133
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,949
considering any measurement and uh as we
are just taking the action and then the

134
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:23,959
are just taking the action and then the
 

135
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,589
are just taking the action and then the
second step involves the measurement

136
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
second step involves the measurement
 

137
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,509
second step involves the measurement
update so it's a normalizing constant

138
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:28,519
update so it's a normalizing constant
 

139
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,990
update so it's a normalizing constant

00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:09,319
mentioning how similar uh because it's
 

161
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:12,390
mentioning how similar uh because it's
exactly what what's happening this uh

probability rules that we have looked at

166
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
probability rules that we have looked at
 

167
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,749
probability rules that we have looked at
the probability review uh video so this

168
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
the probability review uh video so this
 

169
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,110
the probability review uh video so this
one is um very uh similar to the sum

170
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,120

 

171
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,830

Rule and I'll write the sum rule in a

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:28,840
Rule and I'll write the sum rule in a
 

173
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,990
Rule and I'll write the sum rule in a
moment and the this one is similar to

174
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,000
moment and the this one is similar to
 

175
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,550
moment and the this one is similar to
the product

176
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560

 

177
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,070

rule and we'll see how this is also uh

178
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
rule and we'll see how this is also uh
 

179
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,270
rule and we'll see how this is also uh
obviously the product rule is

180
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,280
obviously the product rule is
 

181
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,710
obviously the product rule is
associating itself with the very

182
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:41,720
associating itself with the very
 

183
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,189
associating itself with the very
definition of the base Rule and that's

184
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:44,199
definition of the base Rule and that's
 

185
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,909
definition of the base Rule and that's
why we took the name of base filter and

186
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
why we took the name of base filter and
 

187
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,390
why we took the name of base filter and
filter is a kind of a term that we have

188
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:50,400
filter is a kind of a term that we have
 

189
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,150
filter is a kind of a term that we have
used extensively in electrical

190
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
used extensively in electrical
 

191
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,350
used extensively in electrical
engineering to denote um to to to

actually call functions that are going

194
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
actually call functions that are going
 

195
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,550
actually call functions that are going
to be receiving if you like a stream and

196
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
to be receiving if you like a stream and
 

197
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,110
to be receiving if you like a stream and
uh are are doing exactly the same job

198
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
uh are are doing exactly the same job
 

199
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,430
uh are are doing exactly the same job
over and over again okay so this is uh

200
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
over and over again okay so this is uh
 

201
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,870
over and over again okay so this is uh
basically what's happening over there uh

202
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:07,880
basically what's happening over there uh
 

203
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,749
basically what's happening over there uh
so this function will be called now now

204
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:10,759
so this function will be called now now
 

205
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,029
so this function will be called now now
that we have the

206
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:12,039
that we have the
 

207
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:15,749
that we have the
belief s of T in the next iteration uh

208
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:15,759
belief s of T in the next iteration uh
 

209
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,230
belief s of T in the next iteration uh
this belief of s will actually go here

210
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:18,240
this belief of s will actually go here
 

211
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,830
this belief of s will actually go here
another action will be taken and and a

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:20,840
another action will be taken and and a
 

213
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,629
another action will be taken and and a
measurement will be received and then

214
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:22,639
measurement will be received and then
 

215
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,070
measurement will be received and then
the whole thing will repeat over and

216
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,080
the whole thing will repeat over and
 

217
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,990
the whole thing will repeat over and
over again that's the kind of recursive

218
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
over again that's the kind of recursive
 

219
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,029
over again that's the kind of recursive

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
that the U product rule was uh the very
 

291
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,469
that the U product rule was uh the very

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,710
likelihood times the prior / P of X and
actually we can write that as

322
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
actually we can write that as
 

323
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,750
actually we can write that as

it has to do with a discrete version of
 

337
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,310
it has to do with a discrete version of
this base filter which is the first

338
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
this base filter which is the first
 

339
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,389
this base filter which is the first
implementation we'll see in a moment

340
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
implementation we'll see in a moment
 

341
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,949

times a p of Y uh sorry of x given

342
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:21,959

 

343
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,630

y time P of Y so here you actually can

344
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:25,640
y time P of Y so here you actually can
 

345
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,870
y time P of Y so here you actually can
see that instead of X in this case we

346
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:28,880
see that instead of X in this case we
 

347
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,790
see that instead of X in this case we
have the me measurement z uh let me

348
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:31,800
have the me measurement z uh let me
 

349
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,030
have the me measurement z uh let me
write it instead of Z the

350
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040

 

351
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,590

measurement and instead of why we have

352
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
measurement and instead of why we have
 

353
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,030
measurement and instead of why we have
the

354
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,040

 

355
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,350

state um and uh so this is basically

356
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:48,360
state um and uh so this is basically
 

357
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,990
state um and uh so this is basically
what we have um in this U kind of

358
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,000
what we have um in this U kind of
 

359
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,230
what we have um in this U kind of

another recursion to to update
 

365
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,269
another recursion to to update
and find the next uh version of the

366
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:02,279
and find the next uh version of the
 

367
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:04,750
and find the next uh version of the
state in the next time instant now

368
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:04,760

369
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,230

obviously we need to see some kind of

370
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
obviously we need to see some kind of
 

371
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,949
obviously we need to see some kind of

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,550
see why this kind of makes sense and
we'll have plenty of those and some kind

C the moment I I take an action uh so
this thing is was induced this

427
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,550

uh for uh let's say the
 

433
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,269
uh for uh let's say the
St uh minus one I have um this is my

434
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:38,279
St uh minus one I have um this is my
 

435
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,310
St uh minus one I have um this is my
belief of

436
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:39,320
belief of
 

437
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,389
belief of
St uh so a transition from St minus one

438
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:42,399
St uh so a transition from St minus one
 

439
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,430
St uh so a transition from St minus one
to St and as we will see the

440
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:45,440
to St and as we will see the
 

441
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,710
to St and as we will see the
uncertainty um about the uh New State uh

442
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:49,720
uncertainty um about the uh New State uh
 

443
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,230
uncertainty um about the uh New State uh
is um growing uh in the absence of any

00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:53,240
is um growing uh in the absence of any
 

445
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,150
is um growing uh in the absence of any
measurement and then uh what I do is

446
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,160
measurement and then uh what I do is
 

447
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,750
measurement and then uh what I do is
um uh the measurement is actually coming

448
00:11:59,750 --> 00:11:59,760
um uh the measurement is actually coming
 

449
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,829
um uh the measurement is actually coming
in uh indicating let's say some

in uh indicating let's say some
 

451
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:05,350
in uh indicating let's say some

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,710
is this kind of new uh location with

458
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:13,720

459
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,629

463
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,269

00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:20,279
some

some
correction and uh maybe that correction

466
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:25,199
correction and uh maybe that correction
 

467
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:28,710
correction and uh maybe that correction
will uh uh you know be like this so this

468
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
will uh uh you know be like this so this
 

469
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,310
will uh uh you know be like this so this
will be my my belief of

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:31,320
will be my my belief of
 

471
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,710
will be my my belief of
St and this correction as we will see

472
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
St and this correction as we will see
 

473
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,750
St and this correction as we will see
reduces the uncertainty uh associated

474
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
reduces the uncertainty uh associated
 

475
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,230
reduces the uncertainty uh associated
with the new state so we are uh every

476
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:41,240
with the new state so we are uh every
 

477
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,350
with the new state so we are uh every
time we are moving blind as you can

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,829
behind it is that now that I have um
that additional kind of variable uh what

502
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:15,839
that additional kind of variable uh what
 

503
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,110
that additional kind of variable uh what
can I say uh more about that kind of

504
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
can I say uh more about that kind of
 

505
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,829
can I say uh more about that kind of
posterior okay and definitely that kind

506
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:22,839
posterior okay and definitely that kind
 

507
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:25,590
posterior okay and definitely that kind
of will reduce uh the

508
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:25,600
of will reduce uh the
 

509
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,470
of will reduce uh the
um the uncertainty about my state which

510
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:29,480
um the uncertainty about my state which
 

511
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,870
um the uncertainty about my state which
in this case is a localization use case

512
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:31,880
in this case is a localization use case
 

513
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,790
in this case is a localization use case
so that is the you know whole story of

514
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
so that is the you know whole story of
 

515
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,870
so that is the you know whole story of
what we will see how this kind of filter

516
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
what we will see how this kind of filter
 

517
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,110
what we will see how this kind of filter
operates and uh we will see now that uh

518
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,120
operates and uh we will see now that uh
 

519
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,269
operates and uh we will see now that uh
very clearly in the single dimensional

520
00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:42,279
very clearly in the single dimensional
 

521
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,069
very clearly in the single dimensional
case so what we will do now next we will

522
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:45,079
case so what we will do now next we will
 

523
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:47,829
case so what we will do now next we will
uh first address two cases one is the

524
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:47,839
uh first address two cases one is the
 

525
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,110
uh first address two cases one is the
discrete case uh and uh in the discrete

526
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:51,120
discrete case uh and uh in the discrete
 

527
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,990
discrete case uh and uh in the discrete
case we will see a robot uh trying to

528
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:54,000
case we will see a robot uh trying to
 

529
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,189
case we will see a robot uh trying to
perform that kind of base filter um and

530
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
perform that kind of base filter um and
 

531
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,310
perform that kind of base filter um and
then we will address The Continuous case

532
00:13:59,310 --> 00:13:59,320
then we will address The Continuous case
 

533
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,949
then we will address The Continuous case
uh and this in the continuous case we

534
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
uh and this in the continuous case we
 

535
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,749
uh and this in the continuous case we
will be uh looking at gausian

536
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:03,759
will be uh looking at gausian
 

537
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,389
will be uh looking at gausian
distributions to uh help us quantify the

538
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:07,399
distributions to uh help us quantify the
 

539
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,639
distributions to uh help us quantify the
operation in uh in in that kind of space
