in this video we will introduce
 

3
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:05,789
in this video we will introduce
reinforcement learning and uh

4
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:05,799
reinforcement learning and uh
 

5
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,110
reinforcement learning and uh
reinforcement learning is definitely a

00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:17,880
uh follows after uh the series of videos
 

13
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,750
uh follows after uh the series of videos
that we have developed on Mark of

that we have developed on Mark of
decision processes as uh in mdp we have

16
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:23,080
decision processes as uh in mdp we have
 

17
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,870
decision processes as uh in mdp we have
been assuming full knowledge of the

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,509
been assuming full knowledge of the
problem Dynamics and reward functions

00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:28,519
problem Dynamics and reward functions
 

21
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,790
problem Dynamics and reward functions
and over here we'll start removing that

22
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:30,800
and over here we'll start removing that
 

23
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,389
and over here we'll start removing that
kind of assumption and we will be called

24
00:00:33,389 --> 00:00:33,399
kind of assumption and we will be called
 

25
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,910
kind of assumption and we will be called
to estimate those quantities from

26
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:35,920
to estimate those quantities from
 

27
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,670
to estimate those quantities from
experiences so some of this experiences

28
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:38,680
experiences so some of this experiences
 

29
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,910
experiences so some of this experiences
initially will take the form of

30
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:40,920
initially will take the form of
 

31
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,229
initially will take the form of
sampling uh and so we'll look at Monte

32
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:44,239
sampling uh and so we'll look at Monte
 

33
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,029
sampling uh and so we'll look at Monte
Carlo methods and uh the temporal

34
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:48,039
Carlo methods and uh the temporal
 

35
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,389

difference type of methods as two

36
00:00:50,389 --> 00:00:50,399
difference type of methods as two
 

37
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,750
difference type of methods as two
instances of sampling and then we will

38
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:52,760
instances of sampling and then we will
 

39
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,630
instances of sampling and then we will
introduce a flexible approximation to

40
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:55,640
introduce a flexible approximation to
 

41
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,510
introduce a flexible approximation to
those estimates in the form of neural

42
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:57,520
those estimates in the form of neural
 

43
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,029

networks and conclude the discussion

44
00:01:00,029 --> 00:01:00,039

45
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:02,270

with uh deep reinforcement

46
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,280
with uh deep reinforcement
 

47

also in reinforcement learning we will

50
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:07,159
also in reinforcement learning we will
 

51
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:09,109
also in reinforcement learning we will
divide if you like these uh

52
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:09,119
divide if you like these uh
 

53
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,429

considerations into two steps one is the

54
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:11,439
considerations into two steps one is the
 

55
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,870
considerations into two steps one is the
so-called prediction step where our job

56
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:13,880
so-called prediction step where our job
 

57
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,950
so-called prediction step where our job
is really now to estimate the

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,710
is really now to estimate the
corresponding value functions either the

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:17,720
corresponding value functions either the
 

61
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,069
corresponding value functions either the
V functions or the Q functions now

62
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:20,079
V functions or the Q functions now
 

63
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,030
V functions or the Q functions now
because these functions are going

64
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,040
because these functions are going
 

65
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,670
because these functions are going
to assume no knowledge of any model

66
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
to assume no knowledge of any model

of this accessors kind of states in

effectively uh this state at some point
 

267
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,270
effectively uh this state at some point
it was

268
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,280
it was
 

269
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,390
it was
calculated uh it it it it took the the

270
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:42,400
calculated uh it it it it took the the
 

271
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,550
calculated uh it it it it took the the
the s32 for example took the um the

272
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:45,560
the s32 for example took the um the
 

273
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,469
the s32 for example took the um the
place of s33 and it was itself evaluated

274
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:49,479
place of s33 and it was itself evaluated
 

275
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:51,550
place of s33 and it was itself evaluated
uh at at some uh previous kind of

276
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:51,560
uh at at some uh previous kind of
 

277
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,749
uh at at some uh previous kind of
iteration so we are uh pretending that

278
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:54,759
iteration so we are uh pretending that
 

279
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,350
iteration so we are uh pretending that
s32 is the kind of a sort of root State

280
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,360
s32 is the kind of a sort of root State
 

281
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,990
s32 is the kind of a sort of root State
over here but effectively what we did if

282
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,000
over here but effectively what we did if
 

283
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,390
over here but effectively what we did if
you recall was to um evaluate all states

284
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
you recall was to um evaluate all states
 

285
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,230
you recall was to um evaluate all states
okay so all states these V's are now

286
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,240
okay so all states these V's are now
 

287
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,790
okay so all states these V's are now
vectors and they are evaluating all

288
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:09,800
vectors and they are evaluating all
 

289
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,790
vectors and they are evaluating all
states uh at the same time okay so

290
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
states uh at the same time okay so
 

291
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,110
states uh at the same time okay so
that's basically what was the

292
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:14,120
that's basically what was the
 

293
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,950
that's basically what was the
bootstrapping um and uh and equivalently

294
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:17,960
bootstrapping um and uh and equivalently
 

295
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,710
bootstrapping um and uh and equivalently
we can actually see a diagram over here

296
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:20,720
we can actually see a diagram over here
 

297
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,510
we can actually see a diagram over here
just to um sort of uh that kind of

298
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:24,520
just to um sort of uh that kind of
 

299
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,270
just to um sort of uh that kind of
demonstrates that kind of what I just

300
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,280
demonstrates that kind of what I just
 

301
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,110
demonstrates that kind of what I just
said with a dynamic programming we have

302
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120

310
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,560
evaluating the value function of and uh
 

311
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,149

uh here we are bootstrapping that value

00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:51,400
discussed um and the intuition behind
 

317
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,230

this and obviously in the dynamic kind
 

319
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,670
this and obviously in the dynamic kind
of programing the whole intuition is

320
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:54,680
of programing the whole intuition is
 

321
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,990
of programing the whole intuition is
that you can always start from some kind

322
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:57,000
that you can always start from some kind
 

323
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,550
that you can always start from some kind
of a simple problem uh where let's say

other video we actually call this some

674
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
other video we actually call this some
 

675
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,189

00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:20,199
kind of indication of the calman gain if
 

677
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,949
kind of indication of the calman gain if
you recall all this kind of stuff so

678
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:21,959
you recall all this kind of stuff so
 

679
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,549
you recall all this kind of stuff so
it's exactly the same formula and if you

680
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
it's exactly the same formula and if you
 

681
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,270
it's exactly the same formula and if you
use this actually formula over here

682
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:26,280
use this actually formula over here
 

683
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,630
use this actually formula over here
we'll be able to uh do the uh um sort of

684
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:30,640
we'll be able to uh do the uh um sort of
 

685
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,830
we'll be able to uh do the uh um sort of
uh the up the value

686
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840

688
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:41,080
function with the Monte Carlo method can
 

689
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,950
function with the Monte Carlo method can
be written

690
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:42,960
be written
 

691
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,750
be written
as uh n of s these two steps is equal to

692
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
as uh n of s these two steps is equal to
 

693
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,909
as uh n of s these two steps is equal to
n of s + one incrementing if you like

694
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:50,919
n of s + one incrementing if you like
 

695
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:54,669
n of s + one incrementing if you like
the counter every time we visit State

696
00:17:54,669 --> 00:17:54,679
the counter every time we visit State
 

697
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:59,630
the counter every time we visit State
s okay and the second is to

698
00:17:59,630 --> 00:17:59,640
s okay and the second is to
 

699
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,430
s okay and the second is to
calculate the V of

700
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
calculate the V of
 

701
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,590
calculate the V of
s let's say V Pi of

702
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:04,600
s let's say V Pi of
 

703
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,750
s let's say V Pi of
s is equal

704
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
s is equal
 

705
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,350
s is equal
to uh V Pi of uh V

706
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360

 

707
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,190

Pi of S

708
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:17,200
Pi of S
 

709
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,710
Pi of S
Plus let me call this

710
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:22,720

 

711
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,390

Alpha GT which is the current return as

712
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,400
Alpha GT which is the current return as
 

713
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,230
Alpha GT which is the current return as
it is estimated for that specific for

714
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:29,240
it is estimated for that specific for
 

715
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,350
it is estimated for that specific for
that specific uh episode

716
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:32,360
that specific uh episode
 

717
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,750
that specific uh episode
minus V Pi of

718
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
minus V Pi of
 

719
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,789
minus V Pi of
s so the

720
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:40,799

 

721
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,590

um so this is the previous

722
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:43,600
um so this is the previous
 

723
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,630
um so this is the previous
estimate uh these are the previous

724
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:45,640
estimate uh these are the previous
 

725
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,669
estimate uh these are the previous
estimates now obviously we can

726
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
estimates now obviously we can
 

727
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,270
estimates now obviously we can
distinguish there with the um an index K

728
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:51,280
distinguish there with the um an index K
 

729
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,230
distinguish there with the um an index K
but in implementation you have a left

730
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,240
but in implementation you have a left
 

731
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,870
but in implementation you have a left
hand side uh and the right hand side to

732
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:55,880
hand side uh and the right hand side to
 

733
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,990
hand side uh and the right hand side to
be um sort of separating in a in a let's

734
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,000
be um sort of separating in a in a let's
 

735
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,029
be um sort of separating in a in a let's
say implementation in in software so you

736
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:02,039
say implementation in in software so you
 

737
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,310
say implementation in in software so you
don't need necessarily to put the

738
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:03,320
don't need necessarily to put the
 

739
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,590
don't need necessarily to put the
indices so Alpha in this case is one

740
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:06,600
indices so Alpha in this case is one
 

741
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,830
indices so Alpha in this case is one
over n

742
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:09,840
over n
 

743
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,230
over n
ofs and this uh we can call it the

744
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:13,240
ofs and this uh we can call it the
 

745
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,990
ofs and this uh we can call it the
forgetting

746
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000

 

747
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,149

factor and obviously um this forgetting

748
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:21,159
factor and obviously um this forgetting
 

749
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,470
factor and obviously um this forgetting
factor is less than one this allows us

750
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:23,480
factor is less than one this allows us
 

751
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,710
factor is less than one this allows us
to have a bit more flexibility on uh how

752
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
to have a bit more flexibility on uh how
 

753
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,470
to have a bit more flexibility on uh how
many terms we're able to

754
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:29,480
many terms we're able to
 

755
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,110
many terms we're able to
average uh and uh we can actually call

756
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,120
average uh and uh we can actually call
 

757
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,909
average uh and uh we can actually call
the so this

758
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:33,919
the so this
 

759
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,830
the so this
implementation uh the

760
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:38,840

 

761
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,950

running

762
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
running
 

763
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,750

764
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760

765
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,830
sample
mean of the state value

766
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840

function also worth noting a couple of

768
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:50,600
function also worth noting a couple of
 

769
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,510
function also worth noting a couple of
things from this kind of formula the

770
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:52,520
things from this kind of formula the
 

771
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,909
things from this kind of formula the
first is that uh the estimate no there's

772
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919
first is that uh the estimate no there's
 

773
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,230
first is that uh the estimate no there's
no bootstrapping

774
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:02,240

 

775
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,270

in other words we do

776
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:07,280

 

777
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,789

not

778
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
not
 

779
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,590
not
use an

780
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:12,600

 

781
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,430

estimate

782
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:14,440
estimate
 

783
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,990
estimate
of the value

784
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,000

 

785
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,789

function of a another

786
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799

 

787
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,110

state so there's no bootstrapping here

788
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:28,120
state so there's no bootstrapping here
 

789
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,830
state so there's no bootstrapping here
and uh as effectively the estimates

790
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:30,840
and uh as effectively the estimates
 

791
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,470
and uh as effectively the estimates
between states are kind of independent

792
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
between states are kind of independent
 

793
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,830
between states are kind of independent
of each other and this is also kind of

794
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:34,840
of each other and this is also kind of
 

795
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,230
of each other and this is also kind of
an advantage because computationally

796
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:37,240
an advantage because computationally
 

797
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,310
an advantage because computationally
wise we can actually in any problem that

798
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:39,320
wise we can actually in any problem that
 

799
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,270
wise we can actually in any problem that
we have to estimate value functions for

800
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,280
we have to estimate value functions for
 

801
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,669
we have to estimate value functions for
a subset of the states or even just a

802
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:44,679
a subset of the states or even just a
 

803
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:46,350
a subset of the states or even just a
single kind of state we're able to do so

804
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:46,360
single kind of state we're able to do so
 

805
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,230
single kind of state we're able to do so
with M Carlo methods and the second is

the state value function estimate using
 

891
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,789
the state value function estimate using
let's say first kind of a dynamic

00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:02,799
let's say first kind of a dynamic
 

893
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,909
let's say first kind of a dynamic

894
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:05,919
programming and uh what we will do is we
 

895
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,870
programming and uh what we will do is we
will use uh the formula let's say V Pi

896
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:09,880
will use uh the formula let's say V Pi
 

897
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,070
will use uh the formula let's say V Pi
of

905
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,190
s over here we have uh two uh potential
uh actions that the agent can take

906
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:27,200
uh actions that the agent can take
 

907
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,430
uh actions that the agent can take
either we go left or right at every

00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:29,440
either we go left or right at every
 

909
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,110
either we go left or right at every
state so these

910
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:32,120
state so these
 

911
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,750
state so these
are the general formula but it has to be

912
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:35,760
are the general formula but it has to be
 

913
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,549
are the general formula but it has to be
kind of specialize to the there's a

914
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:39,559
kind of specialize to the there's a
 

915
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,630
kind of specialize to the there's a
transition

916
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:42,640

 

917
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,350

model as we said and then we have here

918
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,360

Prime this was the kind of a bootstrap

924
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:52,640
Prime this was the kind of a bootstrap
 

925
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,789
Prime this was the kind of a bootstrap
this is a dynamic programming solution

926
00:23:59,789 --> 00:23:59,799

 

927
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:04,669

and Gamma here is also equal to

928
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:04,679

 

929
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,110

one all right so

930
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,120
one all right so
 

931
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:11,149
one all right so
the effectively

932
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:11,159
the effectively
 

933
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,909
the effectively
um so AG also need to write also that

934
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:16,919

 

935
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:25,350

agent and go left or

936
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:25,360

 

937
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,470

right uh one step uh one state that it

938
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
right uh one step uh one state that it
 

939
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:36,590
right uh one step uh one state that it
step with equal

940
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:36,600

 

941
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,830

probability okay all right so that's

942
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:38,840
probability okay all right so that's
 

943
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:43,950
probability okay all right so that's
basically uh the policy um so this is

944
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:43,960
basically uh the policy um so this is
 

945
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,990
basically uh the policy um so this is
uh let me call it Pi of a given

946
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,000

 

947
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,590

s is uh 0.5 for

948
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:55,600
s is uh 0.5 for
 

949
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,149
s is uh 0.5 for
left and uh 0.5 5 for

950
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:01,159
left and uh 0.5 5 for
 

951
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:04,870
left and uh 0.5 5 for
right all right so and I can actually uh

952
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:04,880
right all right so and I can actually uh
 

953
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,750
right all right so and I can actually uh
take now each of these

954
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:08,760

 

955
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,350

um possible States and actually write

956
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,360
um possible States and actually write
 

957
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,710
um possible States and actually write
down what will actually be uh that um

958
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:15,720
down what will actually be uh that um
 

959
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,110
down what will actually be uh that um
formula will actually tell us so this

960
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:18,120
formula will actually tell us so this
 

961
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,149
formula will actually tell us so this
will

962
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:19,159
will
 

963
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,830
will
be and this is this is also the before I

964
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:22,840
be and this is this is also the before I
 

965
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,669
be and this is this is also the before I
do so I can actually also write the kind

966
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:24,679
do so I can actually also write the kind
 

967
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,310
do so I can actually also write the kind

terminating but uh that's basically uh
 

981
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:53,909
terminating but uh that's basically uh
in general the backup diagram this is

982
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
in general the backup diagram this is
 

983
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,190
in general the backup diagram this is

this is uh so according to this formula

994
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:18,640
this is uh so according to this formula

00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:31,269
solution and what the the M car actually
will start is will start with some kind

1172
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:31,279
will start is will start with some kind
 

1173
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,549
will start is will start with some kind
of initial kind of vector of

1174
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:33,559
of initial kind of vector of
 

1175
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:38,110
of initial kind of vector of
values and um it will start um you know

1176
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,120
values and um it will start um you know
 

1177
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,710
values and um it will start um you know
trying to estimate the value function

1178
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:40,720
trying to estimate the value function
 

1179
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,310
trying to estimate the value function
based on a number of trajectories with

1180
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:43,320
based on a number of trajectories with
 

1181
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,350
based on a number of trajectories with
this

1182
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:44,360
this
 

1183
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,830
this
averaging uh the running average that we

1184
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:46,840
averaging uh the running average that we
 

1185
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,669
averaging uh the running average that we
have just discussed so this is with one

1186
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:49,679
have just discussed so this is with one
 

1187
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,909
have just discussed so this is with one
trajectory or one episode 10 episodes

1188
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:52,919
trajectory or one episode 10 episodes
 

1189
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:57,070
trajectory or one episode 10 episodes
the green line and the 100 episode uh

1190
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,080
the green line and the 100 episode uh
 

1191
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,909
the green line and the 100 episode uh
estimates are the ones which are

1192
00:31:59,909 --> 00:31:59,919
estimates are the ones which are
 

1193
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,950
estimates are the ones which are
obviously uh going to be coming closer

1194
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:01,960
obviously uh going to be coming closer
 

1195
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,789
obviously uh going to be coming closer
and closer into the the true uh value

1196
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:04,799
and closer into the the true uh value
 

1197
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,440
and closer into the the true uh value
function
