00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,430

so in an earlier video we have seen

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:02,440
so in an earlier video we have seen
 

3
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,309
so in an earlier video we have seen
object detection object detection was

4
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:05,319
object detection object detection was
 

5
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:07,749
object detection object detection was
presented as a capability of a neural

6
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:07,759
presented as a capability of a neural
 

7
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,390
presented as a capability of a neural
network to present to us a stream of

8
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:10,400
network to present to us a stream of
 

9
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,749
network to present to us a stream of
Json a Json stream of where that

10
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:12,759
Json a Json stream of where that
 

11
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:14,829
Json a Json stream of where that
contains bounding box let's say

12
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:14,839
contains bounding box let's say
 

13
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:17,310
contains bounding box let's say
information about objects of interest

14
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:17,320
information about objects of interest
 

15
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,150
information about objects of interest
and uh in that kind of discussion we

16
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:19,160
and uh in that kind of discussion we
 

17
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,710
and uh in that kind of discussion we
also saw a video where uh bounding boxes

18
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:22,720
also saw a video where uh bounding boxes
 

19
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,990
also saw a video where uh bounding boxes
were simply appearing in this specific

20
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,000
were simply appearing in this specific
 

21
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,029
were simply appearing in this specific
frame and maybe disappearing uh in the

22
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:28,039
frame and maybe disappearing uh in the
 

23
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,669
frame and maybe disappearing uh in the
next frame and reappearing in the frame

24
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:29,679
next frame and reappearing in the frame
 

25
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,830
next frame and reappearing in the frame
after that in many Mission critical

26
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:31,840
after that in many Mission critical
 

27
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,110
after that in many Mission critical
applications it's almost impossible to

28
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,120
applications it's almost impossible to
 

29
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,350
applications it's almost impossible to
uh deal with such a kind of a

30
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
uh deal with such a kind of a
 

31
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,950
uh deal with such a kind of a
flickering um um sort of appearance of

32
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:40,960
flickering um um sort of appearance of
 

33
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,470
flickering um um sort of appearance of
the object detection uh output and uh

34
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:44,480
the object detection uh output and uh
 

35
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,229
the object detection uh output and uh
and in fact this appearance this

36
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:46,239
and in fact this appearance this
 

37
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,990
and in fact this appearance this
flickering that we observed in in the um

38
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,000
flickering that we observed in in the um
 

39
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,869
flickering that we observed in in the um
in those videos uh originates from the

40
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:51,879
in those videos uh originates from the
 

41
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,709
in those videos uh originates from the
fact that neural networks are uh sort of

42
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
fact that neural networks are uh sort of
 

43
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,349
fact that neural networks are uh sort of
reflexive uh in nature so they are

44
00:00:59,349 --> 00:00:59,359
reflexive uh in nature so they are
 

45
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,869
reflexive uh in nature so they are
probabilistic devices and as such they

46
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:01,879
probabilistic devices and as such they
 

47
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:04,630
probabilistic devices and as such they
are sort of reflexive in nature so what

48
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
are sort of reflexive in nature so what
 

49
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,230
are sort of reflexive in nature so what
we will do in this kind of video is we

50
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:06,240
we will do in this kind of video is we
 

51
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,749
we will do in this kind of video is we
will investigate approaches where we are

52
00:01:08,749 --> 00:01:08,759
will investigate approaches where we are
 

53
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:12,870
will investigate approaches where we are
going to uh simply uh try to correct uh

54
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:12,880
going to uh simply uh try to correct uh
 

55
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,670
going to uh simply uh try to correct uh
these video outputs and we will be

56
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:14,680
these video outputs and we will be
 

57
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,789
these video outputs and we will be
calling this uh discussion probabilistic

58
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:16,799
calling this uh discussion probabilistic
 

59
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,630
calling this uh discussion probabilistic

00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:32,920
flickering effects we should also
 

73
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,190
flickering effects we should also

uh behind an occlusion and um and I was
 

91
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,310
uh behind an occlusion and um and I was
visible a few moments ago then every

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:00,320
visible a few moments ago then every
 

93
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,789

95
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,590

103
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,630

into uh this type of General topic of

104
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:13,640
into uh this type of General topic of
 

105
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,750
into uh this type of General topic of
tracking objects in a scene so I think

106
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:16,760
tracking objects in a scene so I think
 

107
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,630
tracking objects in a scene so I think
it's also a good idea to uh see the uh

108
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:19,640
it's also a good idea to uh see the uh
 

109
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,710
it's also a good idea to uh see the uh
on our side we have this kind of block

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,990
on our side we have this kind of block

your cell phones uh as uh they have they

168
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
your cell phones uh as uh they have they
 

169
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,509
your cell phones uh as uh they have they
also need to track uh various signals

170
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:44,519
also need to track uh various signals
 

171
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,429
also need to track uh various signals
which are actually being received from

infrastructure let's now try to
 

177
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,869

establish some kind of uh terminology

178
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:55,879
establish some kind of uh terminology
 

179
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:58,550
establish some kind of uh terminology
and notation on the things that we need

180
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
and notation on the things that we need
 

181
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,630
and notation on the things that we need
to study uh to understand a little bit

182
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
to study uh to understand a little bit
 

183
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,550

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,560
how we going to go about addressing this
 

185
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,190
how we going to go about addressing this
kind of a uh issue of correcting for

204
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:32,039
a earlier kind of discussion I have the
 

205
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:35,749
a earlier kind of discussion I have the

row sensing information is coming in and

214
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:50,440
row sensing information is coming in and
 

215
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,870
row sensing information is coming in and
predictions are let's say are coming out

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:52,880
predictions are let's say are coming out
 

217
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,990
predictions are let's say are coming out
and then I have this

218
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,000
and then I have this
 

219
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,749
and then I have this
uh system that I'm discussing about the

220
00:04:57,749 --> 00:04:57,759
uh system that I'm discussing about the
 

221
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,150
uh system that I'm discussing about the
sort of tracking

222
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:01,160
sort of tracking
 

223
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,790
sort of tracking
uh and uh which will also call

224
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:02,800
uh and uh which will also call
 

225
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,189
uh and uh which will also call
probabilistic reasoning over time and

226
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:05,199
probabilistic reasoning over time and
 

227
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,150
probabilistic reasoning over time and
then I have a

228
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160

 

229
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,430

planner and finally I have this kind of

230
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:13,440
planner and finally I have this kind of
 

231
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,790
planner and finally I have this kind of
a

232
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:15,800
a
 

233
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,670
a
actuation or controller if I may call it

234
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:18,680
actuation or controller if I may call it
 

235
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,590
actuation or controller if I may call it
like this and uh this is basically uh

236
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:22,600
like this and uh this is basically uh
 

237
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,629
like this and uh this is basically uh
what is

238
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:23,639
what is
 

239
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,390
what is
been fed back into this environment so

240
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:27,400
been fed back into this environment so
 

241
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,510
been fed back into this environment so
to speak uh that actions are being taken

242
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:30,520
to speak uh that actions are being taken
 

243
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,990
to speak uh that actions are being taken
are causing the change of what we'll be

244
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,000
are causing the change of what we'll be
 

245
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,469
are causing the change of what we'll be
calling uh the

246
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:36,479

 

247
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,150

state so the state is uh uh the uh what

248
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,160
state so the state is uh uh the uh what
 

249
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,629
state so the state is uh uh the uh what
we try to predict it is kept in the

250
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:43,639
we try to predict it is kept in the
 

251
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,070
we try to predict it is kept in the
environment and um the evidently the

252
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,080
environment and um the evidently the
 

253
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,150
environment and um the evidently the
perception is actually giving us some

254
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:50,160
perception is actually giving us some
 

255
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,590
perception is actually giving us some
information about uh what is there let's

256
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:52,600
information about uh what is there let's
 

257
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,510
information about uh what is there let's
say in terms of location of objects

258
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:55,520
say in terms of location of objects
 

259
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,390
say in terms of location of objects
let's say in the current frame um and uh

260
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,400
let's say in the current frame um and uh
 

261
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,469
let's say in the current frame um and uh
in all frames obviously of the video

262
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:01,479
in all frames obviously of the video
 

263
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:04,830
in all frames obviously of the video
stream and uh the tracking is uh going

264
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:04,840
stream and uh the tracking is uh going
 

265
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,150
stream and uh the tracking is uh going
to provide a better uh estimate of this

266
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,160
to provide a better uh estimate of this
 

267
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,390
to provide a better uh estimate of this
kind of state to correct for all this

268
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:10,400
kind of state to correct for all this
 

269
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,510
kind of state to correct for all this
kind of reflexive behavior that we see

270
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
kind of reflexive behavior that we see
 

271
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,830
kind of reflexive behavior that we see
inside the perception system uh so I

272
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:15,840
inside the perception system uh so I
 

273
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,029
inside the perception system uh so I
think it's a good idea to take this term

274
00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:18,039
think it's a good idea to take this term
 

275
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:21,150
think it's a good idea to take this term
first this concept of a state and kind

276
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:21,160
first this concept of a state and kind
 

277
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,110
first this concept of a state and kind
of categorize it and we have plenty of

278
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,120
of categorize it and we have plenty of
 

279
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,830
of categorize it and we have plenty of
states in various problems we'll be uh

280
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:26,840
states in various problems we'll be uh
 

281
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,629
states in various problems we'll be uh
dealing with in this kind of course so

282
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
dealing with in this kind of course so
 

283
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,350
dealing with in this kind of course so
the first um I will call it um Le level

284
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:32,360
the first um I will call it um Le level
 

285
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,830
the first um I will call it um Le level
of a state is the so-call atomic

286
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:34,840
of a state is the so-call atomic
 

287
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,629
of a state is the so-call atomic
state so in the atomic State we simply

288
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
state so in the atomic State we simply
 

289
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,390
state so in the atomic State we simply
do not care uh what is this state

290
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:41,400
do not care uh what is this state
 

291
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,790
do not care uh what is this state
consist of um let's say you are um

292
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:44,800
consist of um let's say you are um
 

293
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,309
consist of um let's say you are um
looking at a uh best path to or best

294
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:49,319
looking at a uh best path to or best
 

295
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,309
looking at a uh best path to or best
trajectory to exit a room and uh you

296
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
trajectory to exit a room and uh you
 

297
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,950
trajectory to exit a room and uh you
divide the room a floor into cells and

298
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:55,960
divide the room a floor into cells and
 

299
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,350
divide the room a floor into cells and
uh that cell um is the the state that

300
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
uh that cell um is the the state that
 

301
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,150
uh that cell um is the the state that
you in right now let's say the location

302
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,160
you in right now let's say the location
 

303
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,550
you in right now let's say the location
and how what locations you will occupy

304
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:05,560
and how what locations you will occupy
 

305
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,749
and how what locations you will occupy
uh to optimally exit the room let's say

306
00:07:07,749 --> 00:07:07,759
uh to optimally exit the room let's say
 

307
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,909
uh to optimally exit the room let's say
in a shortest path or minimum cost um

308
00:07:10,909 --> 00:07:10,919
in a shortest path or minimum cost um
 

309
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:12,909
in a shortest path or minimum cost um
then in order to solve this problem uh

310
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:12,919
then in order to solve this problem uh
 

311
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:16,150
then in order to solve this problem uh
we do not need to decompose uh that

312
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
we do not need to decompose uh that
 

313
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,350
we do not need to decompose uh that
state of that object or robot uh in any

314
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,360
state of that object or robot uh in any
 

315
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,270
state of that object or robot uh in any
finer way uh so that is the sort of so

316
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:24,280
finer way uh so that is the sort of so
 

317
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,350
finer way uh so that is the sort of so
let me write it down uh so planning

00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:26,360
let me write it down uh so planning

00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,749
let me write it down uh so planning

321
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,029

uh sometimes use this Atomic kind of

00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:32,039
uh sometimes use this Atomic kind of
 

323
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,990
uh sometimes use this Atomic kind of
States um and uh in general there will

324
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:35,000

325
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,430

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,070
level and planning is obviously another
uh video uh series of videos that we

332
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,080
uh video uh series of videos that we
 

333
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,990
uh video uh series of videos that we
will uh sort of see a bit later so the

334
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:51,000
will uh sort of see a bit later so the
 

335
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,909
will uh sort of see a bit later so the
um second level is the so-called

336
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:54,919
um second level is the so-called
 

337
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,950
um second level is the so-called
factored uh States and uh we've been

338
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
factored uh States and uh we've been
 

339
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,909
factored uh States and uh we've been
dealing with Factor States all along so

340
00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:00,919
dealing with Factor States all along so
 

341
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,230
dealing with Factor States all along so
to give you an idea of a factor State uh

342
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,240
to give you an idea of a factor State uh
 

343
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,110
to give you an idea of a factor State uh
that is a bit outside of the uh space of

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,029
computer vision let's take the
description of a kinematic state of a of

description of a kinematic state of a of
 

349
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,670

00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:17,680
a vehicle so I'll be calling uh the
 

351
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,830
a vehicle so I'll be calling uh the
state s let's say from now on and I'll

352
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:21,840
state s let's say from now on and I'll
 

353
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,149
state s let's say from now on and I'll
also be decorating it with subscript T

354
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:25,159
also be decorating it with subscript T
 

355
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:26,950
also be decorating it with subscript T
to indicate that there is some kind of a

356

00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:30,039
time dependency on this state and this
 

359
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,430
time dependency on this state and this
date definitely can be decomposed into

00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:45,800
the yo so you have an object in general
 

399
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,350
the yo so you have an object in general
which is located let's say here just

can actually has a roll and it can also
has a y in terms of uh you know the

the potential movements that uh consist
 

411
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,670
the potential movements that uh consist
consist that the the pose of an object

consist that the the pose of an object
consist of okay and then of course you

consist of okay and then of course you
 

415
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,030
consist of okay and then of course you
have some additional ones so that's

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
have some additional ones so that's

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:10,880
books that we have actually recommended
 

503
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,350
books that we have actually recommended
in this kind of course uh because this

504
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
in this kind of course uh because this
 

505
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,269
in this kind of course uh because this
will actually open the door to more

506
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:16,279
will actually open the door to more
 

507
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,110
will actually open the door to more

visual uh slam as we call it uh and but
 

515
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:30,509
visual uh slam as we call it uh and but
you know apart from that let's try and

516
00:12:30,509 --> 00:12:30,519
you know apart from that let's try and
 

517
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:33,189
you know apart from that let's try and
introduce the um what we will be calling

518
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:33,199
introduce the um what we will be calling
 

519
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:36,470
introduce the um what we will be calling
now uh from now on the recursive State

now uh from now on the recursive State
 

521
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:47,110
now uh from now on the recursive State
estimator so let me write this

recursive State estimator so tracking
 

557
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,269
recursive State estimator so tracking
and recursive State estimation is going

558
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:39,279
and recursive State estimation is going
 

559
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,230
and recursive State estimation is going
to be one and the and and the same thing

560
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:42,240
to be one and the and and the same thing
 

561
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,430
to be one and the and and the same thing
um the um State the recursive part is uh

562
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:47,440
um the um State the recursive part is uh
 

563
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,430
um the um State the recursive part is uh
because the um estimation is going to

564
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:49,440
because the um estimation is going to
 

565
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,430
because the um estimation is going to
actually have happen recursively so in

566
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:52,440
actually have happen recursively so in
 

567
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,189
actually have happen recursively so in
in the steps that we we are now going to

568
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:54,199
in the steps that we we are now going to
 

569
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:56,870
in the steps that we we are now going to
be discussing um now in terms of

570
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:56,880
be discussing um now in terms of
 

571
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,910
be discussing um now in terms of
notation we are going to have um the

572
00:13:59,910 --> 00:13:59,920
notation we are going to have um the
 

573
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,790
notation we are going to have um the
first uh apart from the state s oft I

574
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:02,800
first uh apart from the state s oft I
 

575
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,710
first uh apart from the state s oft I
need a a notation about the action

576
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:08,720

 

577
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,509

so so the action is actually uh going to

578
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:12,519
so so the action is actually uh going to
 

579
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:15,230
so so the action is actually uh going to
happen uh as part of this block over

580
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:15,240
happen uh as part of this block over
 

581
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,829
happen uh as part of this block over
here but uh for our discussion we are

582
00:14:17,829 --> 00:14:17,839
here but uh for our discussion we are
 

583
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,910
here but uh for our discussion we are
going to be abstracting away all of this

584
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:19,920
going to be abstracting away all of this
 

585
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,030
going to be abstracting away all of this
kind of planning let's say trajectory

586
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,040
kind of planning let's say trajectory
 

587
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,069
kind of planning let's say trajectory
planning and so on and the various kind

588
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
planning and so on and the various kind
 

589
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,749
planning and so on and the various kind
of control subsystem over here and we'll

590
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:26,759
of control subsystem over here and we'll
 

591
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:28,470
of control subsystem over here and we'll
assume that yes indeed we're taking some

592
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
assume that yes indeed we're taking some
 

593
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,030
assume that yes indeed we're taking some
kind of an ction that will involve

594
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,040
kind of an ction that will involve
 

595
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,910
kind of an ction that will involve
potentially some let's say some movement

596
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:32,920
potentially some let's say some movement
 

597
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,550
potentially some let's say some movement
of the agent in the environment so we

598
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:35,560
of the agent in the environment so we
 

599
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,150
of the agent in the environment so we
will be denoting with a and with subt u

600
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,160
will be denoting with a and with subt u
 

601
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,269
will be denoting with a and with subt u
that kind of action and uh then uh so

602
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:44,279
that kind of action and uh then uh so
 

603
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:47,470
that kind of action and uh then uh so
and the convention is that uh the

604
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:47,480
and the convention is that uh the
 

605
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,470
and the convention is that uh the
agent

606
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:49,480
agent
 

607
00:14:49,480 --> 00:15:00,670
agent
um first takes the action

608
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:00,680

 

609
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,269

and

610
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:02,279
and
 

611
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:10,069
and
then senses the

612
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,079

 

613
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,150

environment so the sensing of the

614
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:12,160
environment so the sensing of the
 

615
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,230
environment so the sensing of the
environment for that we will uh not have

616
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:15,240
environment for that we will uh not have
 

617
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,430
environment for that we will uh not have
another notation so for uh I will call

618
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:18,440
another notation so for uh I will call
 

619
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,470
another notation so for uh I will call
it the uh measurement we will call it

620
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
it the uh measurement we will call it
 

621
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,990
it the uh measurement we will call it
that

622
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000

 

623
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,829

measurement we'll call that as ZT we'll

624
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
measurement we'll call that as ZT we'll
 

625
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,949
measurement we'll call that as ZT we'll
denote it this as the ZT

626
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:29,959
denote it this as the ZT
 

627
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:32,550
denote it this as the ZT
and um and of course the measurement as

628
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:32,560
and um and of course the measurement as
 

629
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,870
and um and of course the measurement as
far as this block is concerned is uh the

630
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:35,880
far as this block is concerned is uh the
 

631
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,749
far as this block is concerned is uh the

uh whatever is comes out of the
 

633
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,030
uh whatever is comes out of the
perception subsystem okay so I we know

634
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
perception subsystem okay so I we know
 

635
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,749

that we have been denoting whatever
 

637
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,509

639
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,030

00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,040
that is actually coming out of this kind
 

641
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,150
that is actually coming out of this kind

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,269
it a bit more compatible with the
literature we changes this y hat to the

646
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:55,279
literature we changes this y hat to the
 

647
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,069
literature we changes this y hat to the
um measurement uh ZT but the framew also

648
00:15:59,069 --> 00:15:59,079
um measurement uh ZT but the framew also
 

649
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:01,069
um measurement uh ZT but the framew also
accommodates a situation where we don't

00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:01,079
accommodates a situation where we don't
 

651
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,069
accommodates a situation where we don't
have necessarily any processing over

have necessarily any processing over
 

653
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:06,790
have necessarily any processing over
here and we just measure uh with ZT

654
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:06,800
here and we just measure uh with ZT
 

655
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,870

00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:40,799
subsystem I am uh creating if you like
 

833
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,590
subsystem I am uh creating if you like
plans based on that information and then

834
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:43,600
plans based on that information and then
 

835
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,950
plans based on that information and then
these plans are executed by the

836
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
these plans are executed by the
 

837
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,470
these plans are executed by the
controller who is taking actions it is

838
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:47,480
controller who is taking actions it is
 

839
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,430
controller who is taking actions it is
going through the these actions are

840
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
going through the these actions are
 

841
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,029
going through the these actions are
changing the state of the environment

842
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:51,039
changing the state of the environment
 

843
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,190
changing the state of the environment
let's say an an action to move and that

844
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,200
let's say an an action to move and that
 

845
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,590
let's say an an action to move and that
uh change state is being observed Again

846
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:56,600
uh change state is being observed Again
 

847
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,549
uh change state is being observed Again
by uh via the row sensing measurements

848
00:20:59,549 --> 00:20:59,559
by uh via the row sensing measurements
 

849
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:01,149
by uh via the row sensing measurements
from the perception system and the whole

850
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:01,159
from the perception system and the whole
 

851
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:04,830
from the perception system and the whole
thing is kind of constantly evolving and

852
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:04,840
thing is kind of constantly evolving and
 

853
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,990
thing is kind of constantly evolving and
uh this evolution of state is what we

854
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:07,000
uh this evolution of state is what we
 

855
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,029
uh this evolution of state is what we
are going to be capturing by the

856
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:09,039
are going to be capturing by the
 

857
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,830
are going to be capturing by the
so-called State transition model how

858
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:11,840
so-called State transition model how
 

859
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,630
so-called State transition model how
probabilistically the state will

860
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:13,640
probabilistically the state will
 

861
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,070
probabilistically the state will
actually change given previous States

862
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,080
actually change given previous States
 

863
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,029
actually change given previous States
and as you will see a bit um later in

864
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
and as you will see a bit um later in
 

865
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,149
and as you will see a bit um later in
fact right now we'll make an important

866
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:21,159
fact right now we'll make an important
 

867
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,110
fact right now we'll make an important
assumption regarding the uh completeness

868
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,120
assumption regarding the uh completeness
 

869
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,110
assumption regarding the uh completeness
of that state will make this uh what is

870
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,120
of that state will make this uh what is
 

871
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,630
of that state will make this uh what is
called a Arian assumption and now we

872
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
called a Arian assumption and now we
 

873
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,149
called a Arian assumption and now we
will discuss the that kind of assumption

874
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:33,159
will discuss the that kind of assumption
 

875
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:40,110
will discuss the that kind of assumption
in detail so a

876
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:40,120

 

877
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:50,110

state St is going to be called

878
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,120

 

879
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,230

complete uh if

880
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:53,240
complete uh if
 

881
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,190
complete uh if
uh it is a it is a complete that's why

882
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:57,200
uh it is a it is a complete that's why
 

883
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,430
uh it is a it is a complete that's why
the name complete is a complete

884
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:03,440

 

885
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,669

summary of the

886
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679

 

887
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,190

past in other words s of T is a

888
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,200
past in other words s of T is a
 

889
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,350
past in other words s of T is a
sufficient

890
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:18,360

 

891
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,870

statistic for all past measurements and

892
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
statistic for all past measurements and
 

893
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:34,110
statistic for all past measurements and
actions

894
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:34,120

 

895
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,590

so the based on that this this is also

896
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:38,600
so the based on that this this is also
 

897
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,310
so the based on that this this is also
known as uh the

898
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:43,320

 

899
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,630

marvian

900
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:47,640

 

901
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,549

Assumption and this actually it is that

902
00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:50,559
Assumption and this actually it is that
 

903
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,549
Assumption and this actually it is that
assumption that actually simplifies

904
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,559
assumption that actually simplifies
 

905
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,190
assumption that actually simplifies
quite a bit a lot of the probability

906
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
quite a bit a lot of the probability
 

907
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,269
quite a bit a lot of the probability
this conditional probability

908
00:22:56,269 --> 00:22:56,279
this conditional probability
 

909
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,710
this conditional probability
distribution we just uh wrote which I'm

910
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
distribution we just uh wrote which I'm
 

911
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,909
distribution we just uh wrote which I'm
going to repeat now so we wrote this s

912
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
going to repeat now so we wrote this s
 

913
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,590
going to repeat now so we wrote this s
of T probability distribution of s of T

914
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:04,600
of T probability distribution of s of T
 

915
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,350
of T probability distribution of s of T
given the previous uh

916
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:08,360
given the previous uh
 

917
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,789
given the previous uh
States uh the uh

918
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:11,799
States uh the uh
 

919
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,590
States uh the uh
actions up to this moment in time T and

920
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:15,600
actions up to this moment in time T and
 

921
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,470
actions up to this moment in time T and
all previous kind of

922
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
all previous kind of
 

923
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,830
all previous kind of
measurements and this is what allows us

924
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:20,840
measurements and this is what allows us
 

925
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,830
measurements and this is what allows us
to write it as

926
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:24,840

 

927
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,789

follows this assumption P of s of T

928
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:27,799
follows this assumption P of s of T
 

929
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:29,750
follows this assumption P of s of T
given s T minus

930
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:29,760
given s T minus
 

931
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,909
given s T minus
one comma a of T and this is a much

932
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:35,919
one comma a of T and this is a much
 

933
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:38,990
one comma a of T and this is a much
simpler um probability distribution uh

934
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,000
simpler um probability distribution uh
 

935
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,390
simpler um probability distribution uh
that we will definitely are going to

936
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:41,400
that we will definitely are going to
 

937
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,710
that we will definitely are going to
have some uh uh hope that we will be

938
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:43,720
have some uh uh hope that we will be
 

939
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,909
have some uh uh hope that we will be
able to um estimate and um and given

940
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
able to um estimate and um and given
 

941
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,710
able to um estimate and um and given
that um uh sort of uh assumption that we

942
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
that um uh sort of uh assumption that we
 

943
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,149
that um uh sort of uh assumption that we
actually made over here I think it's

944
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:52,159
actually made over here I think it's
 

945
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,830
actually made over here I think it's
worthwhile kind of going a little bit

946
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:53,840
worthwhile kind of going a little bit
 

947
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,310
worthwhile kind of going a little bit
over it so we say that uh obviously the

948
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:57,320
over it so we say that uh obviously the
 

949
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,950
over it so we say that uh obviously the
measurements uh that are uh you know are

950
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:00,960
measurements uh that are uh you know are
 

951
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,909
measurements uh that are uh you know are
not really needed at all because at the

952
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:02,919
not really needed at all because at the
 

953
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,870
not really needed at all because at the
end of the day the only thing that

954
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:04,880
end of the day the only thing that
 

955
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,070
end of the day the only thing that
matters is really the previous state s

956
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
matters is really the previous state s
 

957
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,750
matters is really the previous state s
of T minus one because the state is

958
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:10,760
of T minus one because the state is
 

959
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,149
of T minus one because the state is
complete and uh uh but the current

960
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:14,159
complete and uh uh but the current
 

961
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,710
complete and uh uh but the current
action so previous actions are not

962
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:15,720
action so previous actions are not
 

963
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,029
action so previous actions are not
needed but definitely out of the all

964
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:18,039
needed but definitely out of the all
 

965
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,070
needed but definitely out of the all
actions the current action is needed

966
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,080
actions the current action is needed
 

967
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,669
actions the current action is needed
because it is really the current action

968
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:21,679
because it is really the current action
 

969
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,430
because it is really the current action
that it used the St the state transition

970
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:24,440
that it used the St the state transition
 

971
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,669
that it used the St the state transition
so let me write it down uh action

972
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:28,679
so let me write it down uh action
 

973
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:29,830
so let me write it down uh action
at

974
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:29,840
at
 

975
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,269
at
T

976
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:32,279
T
 

977
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:38,149
T
induces the state

978
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159

 

979
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,430

transition from St

980
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
transition from St
 

981
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,590
transition from St
minus1 to St okay so that's why we have

982
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:46,600
minus1 to St okay so that's why we have
 

983
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,990
minus1 to St okay so that's why we have
have to have and uh you know uh

984
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,000
have to have and uh you know uh
 

985
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,669
have to have and uh you know uh
considering that kind of action in other

986
00:24:50,669 --> 00:24:50,679
considering that kind of action in other
 

987
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:52,950
considering that kind of action in other
words then we have this transition okay

988
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:52,960
words then we have this transition okay
 

989
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,669
words then we have this transition okay
the specific action ofd and now we will

990
00:24:55,669 --> 00:24:55,679
the specific action ofd and now we will
 

991
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,789
the specific action ofd and now we will
need to introduce another U the second

992
00:24:58,789 --> 00:24:58,799
need to introduce another U the second
 

993
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,389
need to introduce another U the second
probabilistic model uh the so we we have

994
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:02,399
probabilistic model uh the so we we have
 

995
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:03,909
probabilistic model uh the so we we have
going to have two main probabilistic

996
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:03,919
going to have two main probabilistic
 

997
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,510
going to have two main probabilistic
model what we have to introduce so we

998
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:06,520
model what we have to introduce so we
 

999
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,149
model what we have to introduce so we
introduce a state transition what causes

1000
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:09,159

allows us to capture that um in uh and
 

1007
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,190
allows us to capture that um in uh and

1017
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,830

1019
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,310

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
or let's say the desk over here so that
 

1085
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,950
or let's say the desk over here so that
is what this probability distribution is

1086
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:09,960
is what this probability distribution is
 

1087
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,389
is what this probability distribution is
actually capturing uh for example we'll

be assuming in a bit later will be

1090
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:14,520
be assuming in a bit later will be
 

1091
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,590
be assuming in a bit later will be
assuming that this probability

1092
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:15,600
assuming that this probability
 

1093
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,389
assuming that this probability
distribution has could be continuous and

1094
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:18,399
distribution has could be continuous and
 

1095
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,230
distribution has could be continuous and
it will be um let's say um or discrete

1096
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:21,240
it will be um let's say um or discrete
 

1097
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,110
it will be um let's say um or discrete
and will take some kind of uh

1098
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,120
and will take some kind of uh
 

1099
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,149
and will take some kind of uh
distribution around it let's say for

1100
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:26,159
distribution around it let's say for
 

1101
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,549
distribution around it let's say for
continuous will be a gausian

1102
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
continuous will be a gausian
 

1103
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,230
continuous will be a gausian
okay and so that is U uh the second kind

1104
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
okay and so that is U uh the second kind
 

1105
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,549
okay and so that is U uh the second kind
of model so we have now two models one

1106
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:34,559
of model so we have now two models one
 

1107
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,710
of model so we have now two models one
governs the state transition the other

1108
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:36,720
governs the state transition the other
 

1109
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,509
governs the state transition the other
governs the measurements and uh in uh we

1110
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:41,519
governs the measurements and uh in uh we
 

1111
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,029
governs the measurements and uh in uh we
we also need to have some uh

1112
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:44,039
we also need to have some uh
 

1113
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,269

evidently is dependent on the state I am
and uh the action and the current state

and uh the action and the current state
 

1257
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,350
and uh the action and the current state
is is inducing that kind of state

1335
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:33,629

now we will simp simplify this posterior

1336
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:33,639
now we will simp simplify this posterior
 

1337
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:35,950
now we will simp simplify this posterior
also uh but

1338
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:35,960
also uh but
 

1339
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,909
also uh but
um this belief heart will be uh the

1340
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:39,919
um this belief heart will be uh the
 

1341
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,710
um this belief heart will be uh the
belief will indicate the

1342
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720

 

1343
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,990

1351
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:01,750

that's the emphasis before taking

1352
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:01,760
that's the emphasis before taking
 

1353
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,470
that's the emphasis before taking
measurements before

1354
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:06,480

 

1355
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,909

receiving

1356
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:10,919

00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:12,550

measurement

1358
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:12,560
measurement
 

1359
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,030
measurement
ZT and that's why the index ends at z uh

1360
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,040
ZT and that's why the index ends at z uh
 

1361
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,430
ZT and that's why the index ends at z uh
T minus one okay so this is the belief

1362
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:19,440
T minus one okay so this is the belief
 

1363
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,550
T minus one okay so this is the belief
and we'll see now the belief C and this

1364
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:21,560
and we'll see now the belief C and this
 

1365
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,069
and we'll see now the belief C and this
is uh we'll we'll see in a moment how

1366
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:24,079
is uh we'll we'll see in a moment how
 

1367
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,109
is uh we'll we'll see in a moment how
the two are involved um together how

1368
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
the two are involved um together how
 

1369
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,510
the two are involved um together how
they we are going to use them um so the

1370
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:30,520
they we are going to use them um so the
 

1371
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,190
they we are going to use them um so the
second posterior probability

1372
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,200
second posterior probability

1374
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720
distribution that I want probability I
 

1375
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,349
distribution that I want probability I
want to uh specify is the belief of uh

1376
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:37,359
want to uh specify is the belief of uh
 

1377
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,550
want to uh specify is the belief of uh
being in in state

1378
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:39,560
being in in state
 

1379
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:45,030
being in in state
St and uh uh this is uh the the

1380
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,040
St and uh uh this is uh the the
 

1381
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,589
St and uh uh this is uh the the
posterior P of

1382
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:49,599

 

1383
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,990

St given a from one to

1384
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:53,000
St given a from one to
 

1385
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,750
St given a from one to
T and C from one to T this time

1386
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:58,760
T and C from one to T this time
 

1387
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,589
T and C from one to T this time
so it's exactly the same thing the

1388
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:03,599

 

1389
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,430

1394
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:21,920

 

1395
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,069

ZT after receiving measurement R City so

1396
00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:25,079
ZT after receiving measurement R City so
 

1397
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,870
ZT after receiving measurement R City so
these are the two um I will call it key

1398
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:28,880
these are the two um I will call it key
 

1399
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,190
these are the two um I will call it key
uh posteriors that we will uh need to

1400
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:32,200
uh posteriors that we will uh need to
 

1401
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,870
uh posteriors that we will uh need to
start finding a way recursive way of

1402
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:34,880
start finding a way recursive way of
 

1403
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,030
start finding a way recursive way of
estimating evidently we need this um and

1404
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,040
estimating evidently we need this um and
 

1405
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,950
estimating evidently we need this um and
then uh what was going to happen in this

1406
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
then uh what was going to happen in this
 

1407
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,829
then uh what was going to happen in this
kind of recursion is that if we have

1408
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:44,839
kind of recursion is that if we have
 

1409
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:47,670
kind of recursion is that if we have
given if you like the diagram if we have

1410
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:47,680
given if you like the diagram if we have
 

1411
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,990
given if you like the diagram if we have
an estimate of um uh the belief of of

1412
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,000
an estimate of um uh the belief of of
 

1413
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,430
an estimate of um uh the belief of of
this kind of State in an estimate a

1414
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:54,440
this kind of State in an estimate a
 

1415
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,190
this kind of State in an estimate a
posterior probability of being in that

1416
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,200
posterior probability of being in that
 

1417
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,630
posterior probability of being in that
kind of state then we'll be updated

1418
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:57,640
kind of state then we'll be updated
 

1419
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,270
kind of state then we'll be updated
meaning that in the next time uh this

1420
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:00,280
meaning that in the next time uh this
 

1421
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,630
meaning that in the next time uh this
will actually be um used next time to

1422
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:03,640
will actually be um used next time to
 

1423
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,990
will actually be um used next time to
come with an estimate of this posterior

1424
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,000
come with an estimate of this posterior
 

1425
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,230
come with an estimate of this posterior
at T +1 now we'll need to see how this

1426
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:08,240
at T +1 now we'll need to see how this
 

1427
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,880
at T +1 now we'll need to see how this
is going to be done
