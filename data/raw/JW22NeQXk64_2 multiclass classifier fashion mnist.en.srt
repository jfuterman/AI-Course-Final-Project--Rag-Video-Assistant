00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:20,600
this uh okay so we have here at the
 

13
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,550
this uh okay so we have here at the
bottom of this pyramid is the input

X okay this pencil is all right we have

16
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:28,519
X okay this pencil is all right we have
 

17
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:33,590
X okay this pencil is all right we have
this x which is is fitting the input um

this x which is is fitting the input um
 

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,030
this x which is is fitting the input um
and we'll call this the so-called input

20
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,040
and we'll call this the so-called input
 

21
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,470

stacks of additional layers one uh one
 

25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,790

be connected to all of the
 

49
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,630
be connected to all of the

and so on so I'm not going to draw all
 

53
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,990
and so on so I'm not going to draw all
the lines because it will be a fairly

00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,000
the lines because it will be a fairly
 

55
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,590
the lines because it will be a fairly
messy kind of Di diagram and uh okay

56
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
messy kind of Di diagram and uh okay
 

57
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,469
messy kind of Di diagram and uh okay
maybe I drew too

58
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:36,479
maybe I drew too
 

59
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,109

typically also known as dense because
 

101
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,149
typically also known as dense because
there's a dense connectivity

there's a dense connectivity
 

103
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:51,070
there's a dense connectivity
diagram uh and a dense Matrix which is

189
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,830

kind of dimensionality uh reduction uh
 

205
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,150
kind of dimensionality uh reduction uh
right here at this point so our W Matrix

206
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
right here at this point so our W Matrix
 

207
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,029
right here at this point so our W Matrix

225
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,189
uh smaller uh than the n n x all we need

235
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,230

00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,240
multiplication some authors also treat
 

237
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,510
multiplication some authors also treat
it as a left hand side it's one and the

1 so this multiplication now makes sense

244
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919

245
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,950

00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:36,639
can just make sure that we have NZ less
 

251
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,589
can just make sure that we have NZ less

that a new uh nonlinear

270
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,560
that a new uh nonlinear

00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,270
that a new uh nonlinear
unit that I am going to plot over

272
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:06,280

 

273
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,550

here this nonlinear unit that we call

274
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:09,560
here this nonlinear unit that we call
 

275
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,990
here this nonlinear unit that we call
the reu is called rectified linear unit

276
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,000
the reu is called rectified linear unit
 

277
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,629
the reu is called rectified linear unit
it is linear unit for all positive value

278
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:15,639
it is linear unit for all positive value
 

279
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,950
it is linear unit for all positive value
so that's this angle is

280
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
so that's this angle is
 

281
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,990
so that's this angle is
45° uh 45° and then we have

282
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
45° uh 45° and then we have
 

283
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,150
45° uh 45° and then we have
U the input Z and the output this axis

284
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,160
U the input Z and the output this axis
 

285
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,150
U the input Z and the output this axis
is Ru of

286
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,160
is Ru of
 

287
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,189
is Ru of
Z and uh the all

288
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:35,199
Z and uh the all
 

289
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,510
Z and uh the all
negative logits Z are mapped to zero and

290
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
negative logits Z are mapped to zero and
 

291
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,390
negative logits Z are mapped to zero and
that's what makes it nonlinear if you

292
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,400
that's what makes it nonlinear if you
 

293
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,230
that's what makes it nonlinear if you
have minus one it's zero if you have one

294
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:43,240
have minus one it's zero if you have one
 

295
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,909
have minus one it's zero if you have one
minus one million it's also zero okay so

296
00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:46,919
minus one million it's also zero okay so
 

297
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,869
minus one million it's also zero okay so
um the um reu from now on we will write

298
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
um the um reu from now on we will write
 

299
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,110
um the um reu from now on we will write
it as a an expression which

300
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
it as a an expression which
 

301
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,790

layer and so let's now uh move into into

334
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:50,560
layer and so let's now uh move into into
 

335
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,150
layer and so let's now uh move into into
this example and see what

336
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
this example and see what
 

337
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,310
this example and see what
happens an example application that

338
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
happens an example application that
 

339
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,990
happens an example application that
we're going to see is the so-called

340
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,000
we're going to see is the so-called
 

341
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,670
we're going to see is the so-called
multiclass classification

342
00:08:59,670 --> 00:08:59,680
multiclass classification
 

343
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,870
multiclass classification
and for that uh application we'll be

344
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:01,880
and for that uh application we'll be
 

345
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,269
and for that uh application we'll be
using a notebook that is in our site

346
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
using a notebook that is in our site
 

347
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,509
using a notebook that is in our site
called the shold fashionist case

348
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:08,519
called the shold fashionist case
 

349
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,949
called the shold fashionist case
study uh the um notebook can be launched

350

specific example it's actually a good
 

369
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,389
specific example it's actually a good
idea to change the runtime type to uh

370
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:41,399
idea to change the runtime type to uh
 

371
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,230
idea to change the runtime type to uh
that of uh

372
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,240
that of uh
 

373
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,710
that of uh
GPU and you can select the cheapest kind

know pay a subscription to Google then
 

381
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,150
know pay a subscription to Google then
you can select some more powerful GP but

382
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,160
you can select some more powerful GP but
 

383
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,630
you can select some more powerful GP but
for our application here uh that that

384
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
for our application here uh that that
 

385
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,350
for our application here uh that that

multiclass classification so people have
 

463
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,710
multiclass classification so people have
thought about uh how we can create a bit

464
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:50,720
thought about uh how we can create a bit
 

465
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,389
thought about uh how we can create a bit
more challenging data set and they came

466

more challenging data set and they came
 

467
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,069
more challenging data set and they came
out U with the So-Cal fashionist which

uh training images after we split our

494
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:39,959
uh training images after we split our
 

495
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,110
uh training images after we split our
data set to a train and and validation

496
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,120
data set to a train and and validation
 

497
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,550
data set to a train and and validation
or test as it's called here and the U uh

498
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:47,560
or test as it's called here and the U uh
 

499
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,829
or test as it's called here and the U uh
we can actually run uh this whole

500
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
we can actually run uh this whole
 

501
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,269
we can actually run uh this whole
notebook in one go or run every cell

502
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:53,279
notebook in one go or run every cell
 

503
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,590
notebook in one go or run every cell
individually as we go along so if you go

504
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
individually as we go along so if you go
 

505
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,710
individually as we go along so if you go
to runtime uh since we Chang it to a GPU

506
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:58,720
to runtime uh since we Chang it to a GPU
 

507
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,310
to runtime uh since we Chang it to a GPU
and press the run all buttom then uh The

508
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
and press the run all buttom then uh The
 

509
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,710
and press the run all buttom then uh The
Notebook will be executed and we should

510
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:04,720
Notebook will be executed and we should
 

511
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,990
Notebook will be executed and we should
actually start seeing some um examples

512
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,000
actually start seeing some um examples
 

513
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,990
actually start seeing some um examples
some outputs uh from the code cells so

514
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,000
some outputs uh from the code cells so
 

515
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,430
some outputs uh from the code cells so
here we see the U you know 28x 28 uh

516
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:17,440
here we see the U you know 28x 28 uh
 

517
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,829
here we see the U you know 28x 28 uh
pixels images that we are going to be uh

518
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:20,839
pixels images that we are going to be uh
 

519
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:23,910
pixels images that we are going to be uh
processing and so what we will do now is

520
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
processing and so what we will do now is
 

521
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,269
processing and so what we will do now is
we will um scroll a little bit just to

522
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
we will um scroll a little bit just to
 

523
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,870
we will um scroll a little bit just to
see some examples and stay at this point

524
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:29,880
see some examples and stay at this point
 

525
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,790
see some examples and stay at this point
that we are going to be building a Model

526
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:31,800
that we are going to be building a Model
 

527
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,310
that we are going to be building a Model
A predictor uh this predictor is going

528
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
A predictor uh this predictor is going
 

529
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,750
A predictor uh this predictor is going
to be consisting of fully connected

530
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:37,760
to be consisting of fully connected
 

531
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,189
to be consisting of fully connected
layers and uh this is our model over

532
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:41,199
layers and uh this is our model over
 

533
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,150
layers and uh this is our model over
here and what we will do is we'll uh

534
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,160
here and what we will do is we'll uh
 

535
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,629
here and what we will do is we'll uh
convert this uh lines of code into a

536
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
convert this uh lines of code into a
 

537
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,750
convert this uh lines of code into a
diagram in our uh sort of uh document

538
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:49,760
diagram in our uh sort of uh document
 

539
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,269
diagram in our uh sort of uh document
camera here and so I'm going to stop and

540
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:52,279
camera here and so I'm going to stop and
 

541
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:54,829
camera here and so I'm going to stop and
switch to the other scene where we have

542
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:54,839
switch to the other scene where we have
 

543
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,030
switch to the other scene where we have
been uh will'll be

544
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,040
been uh will'll be
 

545
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,189
been uh will'll be
writing and generating if you like this

546
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:00,199
writing and generating if you like this
 

547
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:04,949
writing and generating if you like this
uh this diagram okay so let's see we are

548
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
uh this diagram okay so let's see we are
 

549
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,710
uh this diagram okay so let's see we are
going to turn the page a little bit

550
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
going to turn the page a little bit
 

551
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,030
going to turn the page a little bit
because we are have a bit more elaborate

552
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,040
because we are have a bit more elaborate
 

553
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,230
because we are have a bit more elaborate
diagram to draw so I'm going to title

554
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:13,240
diagram to draw so I'm going to title
 

555
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,230

this U the

556
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:16,240
this U the
 

557
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,550
this U the

00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:18,560
uh let me call it
 

559
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,870
uh let me call it
a

563
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,389
multi-layer
multi-layer let me also bring the

564
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:26,399
multi-layer let me also bring the
 

565
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,590
multi-layer let me also bring the
microphone close by so multilayer ler

566
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:30,600
microphone close by so multilayer ler
 

567
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,110

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,110

classification and this is the so-called

570
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:40,120
classification and this is the so-called
 

571
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,110

575
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,030

architecture so uh the model if we see

576
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,040
architecture so uh the model if we see
 

577
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,030
architecture so uh the model if we see
the code uh is uh going to be able to

578
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,040
the code uh is uh going to be able to
 

579
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,550
the code uh is uh going to be able to
process uh this type of data however

580
00:14:59,550 --> 00:14:59,560
process uh this type of data however
 

581
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,590
process uh this type of data however
we are not ready yet to process images

582
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:02,600
we are not ready yet to process images
 

583
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,430
we are not ready yet to process images
uh so what we will do is we will flatten

584
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,440
uh so what we will do is we will flatten
 

585
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,269
uh so what we will do is we will flatten
this 28x 28 images so remember that we

586
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:08,279
this 28x 28 images so remember that we
 

587
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,310
this 28x 28 images so remember that we
are been dealing with we have been given

588
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:11,320
are been dealing with we have been given
 

589
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,350
are been dealing with we have been given
this

590
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:14,360

images uh sort of representing some kind

594
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
images uh sort of representing some kind
 

595
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,710
images uh sort of representing some kind
of fashion item

596
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:24,720

 

597
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,470

um something like that and uh and then

598
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:29,480
um something like that and uh and then
 

599
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,309
um something like that and uh and then
we are going to um uh flatten that kind

600
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:33,319
we are going to um uh flatten that kind
 

601
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:36,829
we are going to um uh flatten that kind
of image to create a vector so the first

602
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:36,839
of image to create a vector so the first
 

603
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,990
of image to create a vector so the first
thing that happens is that we take this

604
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,000
thing that happens is that we take this
 

605
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,189
thing that happens is that we take this
uh X let me call it X Prime for a lack

606
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:43,199
uh X let me call it X Prime for a lack
 

607
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,870
uh X let me call it X Prime for a lack
of a better letter and we will pass it

608
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:45,880
of a better letter and we will pass it
 

609
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,949
of a better letter and we will pass it
through the

610
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:50,959

 

611
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,910

flatten function to create an X and if

612
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
flatten function to create an X and if
 

613
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,550
flatten function to create an X and if
this x Prime is 20 by 28 well if you

614
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:58,560
this x Prime is 20 by 28 well if you
 

615
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,870
this x Prime is 20 by 28 well if you
multiply 28 by 28 you have you're coming

616
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:00,880
multiply 28 by 28 you have you're coming
 

617
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,030
multiply 28 by 28 you have you're coming
up with a number called 768 okay so it

618
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,040
up with a number called 768 okay so it
 

619
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,189
up with a number called 768 okay so it
is going to be

620
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:06,199
is going to be
 

621
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,030
is going to be
768 * 1 that's my Vector over here and

622
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
768 * 1 that's my Vector over here and
 

623
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,470
768 * 1 that's my Vector over here and
then from that point onwards we will be

624
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:13,480
then from that point onwards we will be
 

625
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,470
then from that point onwards we will be
applying a stacking of fully connected

626
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:16,480
applying a stacking of fully connected
 

627
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,710
applying a stacking of fully connected
or dense layers as we call them uh

628
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:18,720
or dense layers as we call them uh
 

629
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,629
or dense layers as we call them uh
earlier so we

630
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
earlier so we
 

631
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:27,150
earlier so we
are going to be applying uh this uh W1 *

632
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,160
are going to be applying uh this uh W1 *
 

633
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,829
are going to be applying uh this uh W1 *
X

followed by the so-called bias

636
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:36,399

 

637
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,550

one followed by

638
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,560

 

639
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,790

00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
aelu to generate the
 

641
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,389
aelu to generate the
H1 and then uh we are going to see

642
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
H1 and then uh we are going to see
 

643
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,430
H1 and then uh we are going to see
exactly what are the dimensions that I

644
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,440
exactly what are the dimensions that I
 

645
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,670
exactly what are the dimensions that I
want us to use over here um so in this

646
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:54,680
want us to use over here um so in this
 

647
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,749
want us to use over here um so in this
specific example in this specific code I

648
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:56,759
specific example in this specific code I
 

649
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,749
specific example in this specific code I
can see that they want us to use

650
00:16:59,749 --> 00:16:59,759
can see that they want us to use
 

651
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,990
can see that they want us to use
um to to have a a dimensionality

652
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,000
um to to have a a dimensionality
 

653
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,949
um to to have a a dimensionality
reduction from

00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,270

128 uh size over here so my H1 over here

658
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,280
128 uh size over here so my H1 over here
 

659
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,230
128 uh size over here so my H1 over here
is going to be a

660
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:15,240
is going to be a
 

661
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,829
is going to be a
128 *

662
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:17,839
128 *
 

663
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,750
128 *
1 all right so what is uh now going to

664
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:22,760
1 all right so what is uh now going to
 

665
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,789
1 all right so what is uh now going to
happen is that we have now the first

666
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:25,799
happen is that we have now the first
 

667
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,069
happen is that we have now the first
layer kind of

668
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,079
layer kind of
 

669
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,029
layer kind of
completed so the outut of this kind of

670
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:30,039
completed so the outut of this kind of
 

671
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:35,510
completed so the outut of this kind of
layer is going to uh go into another

672
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:35,520
layer is going to uh go into another
 

673
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,150
layer is going to uh go into another
dense layer uh but this dense layer is

674
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
dense layer uh but this dense layer is
 

675
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,270
dense layer uh but this dense layer is
going to um be the head of the network

676
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:42,280
going to um be the head of the network
 

677
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,350
going to um be the head of the network
so we will take H1 and we will pass it

678
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,360
so we will take H1 and we will pass it
 

679
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,990
so we will take H1 and we will pass it
through another transformation another

680
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,000
through another transformation another
 

681
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,990
through another transformation another
reduction well we know exactly the

682
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
reduction well we know exactly the
 

683
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,870
reduction well we know exactly the
number of Dimensions that we need to hit

684
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:55,880
number of Dimensions that we need to hit
 

685
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,510
number of Dimensions that we need to hit
since is our last layer in the network

686
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:58,520
since is our last layer in the network
 

687
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,149
since is our last layer in the network
is evidently going to be 10 because we

688
00:18:01,149 --> 00:18:01,159
is evidently going to be 10 because we
 

689
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,310
is evidently going to be 10 because we
have 10 classes to classify we need to

690
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
have 10 classes to classify we need to
 

691
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,029
have 10 classes to classify we need to
have a 10 dimensional Vector uh at the

692
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:08,039
have a 10 dimensional Vector uh at the
 

693
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,430
have a 10 dimensional Vector uh at the
output of the of the network so we'll

694
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:10,440
output of the of the network so we'll
 

695
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,470
output of the of the network so we'll
see exactly how we will convert this

696
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
see exactly how we will convert this
 

697
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,070
see exactly how we will convert this
Vector into probabilities in a moment

698
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,080
Vector into probabilities in a moment
 

699
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,029
Vector into probabilities in a moment
but that's basically the in terms of

700
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:17,039
but that's basically the in terms of
 

701
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,310
but that's basically the in terms of
Dimensions at least we know what we will

702
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:19,320
Dimensions at least we know what we will
 

703
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:25,270
Dimensions at least we know what we will
end up so this is going to be

704
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,280
end up so this is going to be
 

705
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,430
end up so this is going to be
W2

706
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:27,440
W2
 

707
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,430

709
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,990

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,070

bias that's a second layer bias and then

712
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,080
bias that's a second layer bias and then
 

713
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,029
bias that's a second layer bias and then
uh we are going to

714
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
uh we are going to
 

715
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,470
uh we are going to
have

716
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:43,480
have
 

717
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:50,870
have
uh a block that we'll be calling soft

718
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880

 

719
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,789

Max that is going to produce for us the

00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:54,799
Max that is going to produce for us the
 

721
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,870
Max that is going to produce for us the
Y heart and let me now explain what a

722
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:57,880
Y heart and let me now explain what a
 

723
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,430
Y heart and let me now explain what a
soft Max is and uh why we didn't have a

724
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:00,440
soft Max is and uh why we didn't have a
 

725
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,789
soft Max is and uh why we didn't have a
Ru first of all so if we had um a deeper

726
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:06,799
Ru first of all so if we had um a deeper
 

727
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,070
Ru first of all so if we had um a deeper
kind of network we would actually repeat

728
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,080
kind of network we would actually repeat
 

729
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,789
kind of network we would actually repeat
more than one time this kind of layer

730
00:19:11,789 --> 00:19:11,799
more than one time this kind of layer
 

731
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,950
more than one time this kind of layer
evidently with a different kind of

732
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:13,960
evidently with a different kind of
 

733
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,630
evidently with a different kind of
dimensionality so we will go from 128

734
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:16,640
dimensionality so we will go from 128
 

735
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,950
dimensionality so we will go from 128
perhaps to let's say 64 and then from 64

736
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960
perhaps to let's say 64 and then from 64
 

737
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,669
perhaps to let's say 64 and then from 64
uh down to 10 uh right now the author of

uh down to 10 uh right now the author of
 

739
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:26,669
uh down to 10 uh right now the author of
The Notebook suggested that you know one

740
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:26,679
The Notebook suggested that you know one
 

741
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:29,070
The Notebook suggested that you know one
layer is enough and I agree for the

742
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,080
layer is enough and I agree for the
 

743
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,029
layer is enough and I agree for the
specific um type of complexity uh of the

744
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:33,039
specific um type of complexity uh of the
 

745
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,950
specific um type of complexity uh of the
target function I think it's okay uh so

746
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:35,960
target function I think it's okay uh so
 

747
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,029
target function I think it's okay uh so
we don't have another layer uh uh but uh

748
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:39,039
we don't have another layer uh uh but uh
 

749
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,350
we don't have another layer uh uh but uh
in the head over here we are going to be

750
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
in the head over here we are going to be
 

751
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,549
in the head over here we are going to be
facing and and solving the following

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:46,080
kind of problem so we are going to have
 

755
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,549

some uh let me call them uh this Vector
 

757
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,590
some uh let me call them uh this Vector
over here Z1 as we always we're calling

Logics uh broadly speaking we talking

766
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:05,320
Logics uh broadly speaking we talking
 

767
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,110
Logics uh broadly speaking we talking
about a sort of

768
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
about a sort of
 

769
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,110
about a sort of
unnormalized uh probabilities um that is

770
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
unnormalized uh probabilities um that is
 

771
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,350
unnormalized uh probabilities um that is
coming out of this uh dot product and

772
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
coming out of this uh dot product and
 

773
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,710
coming out of this uh dot product and
this is um this Vector Z2 here evidently

774
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:19,720
this is um this Vector Z2 here evidently
 

775
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,789
this is um this Vector Z2 here evidently
has dimensionality of 10 * 1 okay so let

776
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:22,799
has dimensionality of 10 * 1 okay so let
 

777
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:26,510
has dimensionality of 10 * 1 okay so let
me write this down 10 * 1 so what we

778
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:26,520
me write this down 10 * 1 so what we
 

779
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,350
me write this down 10 * 1 so what we
want to produce at the output is a

780
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,360
want to produce at the output is a
 

781
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,190
want to produce at the output is a
posterior probability and this posterior

782
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:32,200
posterior probability and this posterior
 

783
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,070
posterior probability and this posterior
probability we already have met many

784
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,080
probability we already have met many
 

785
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,510
probability we already have met many
times in the binary classification case

786
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:36,520
times in the binary classification case
 

787
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,470
times in the binary classification case
so if we had a binary classification

788
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,480
so if we had a binary classification
 

789
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,270
so if we had a binary classification
case well evidently we needed to just

790
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,280
case well evidently we needed to just
 

791
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,990
case well evidently we needed to just
produce a scalar at the output uh where

792
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:45,000
produce a scalar at the output uh where
 

793
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,750
produce a scalar at the output uh where
the Y hat will be the probability of the

794
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:46,760
the Y hat will be the probability of the
 

795
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,669
the Y hat will be the probability of the
positive class given

796
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:48,679
positive class given
 

797
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,789
positive class given
x uh however over here we are not going

798
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:51,799

799
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:54,630

to have a scaler we need to have 10

800
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:54,640
to have a scaler we need to have 10
 

801
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,310
to have a scaler we need to have 10
probabilities so we need to produce a

802
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,320
probabilities so we need to produce a
 

803
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,110
probabilities so we need to produce a
probability distribution so that's the

804
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,120
probability distribution so that's the
 

805
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,510
probability distribution so that's the
first important uh point so the

806
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:03,520
first important uh point so the
 

807
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,789
first important uh point so the
body uh which is uh

808
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:09,799

if we are to report that this would
 

883
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,669
if we are to report that this would
actually perform an argmax operator so

actually perform an argmax operator so
 

885
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,669
actually perform an argmax operator so
it's

not definitely report a class let's say
 

923
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,110
not definitely report a class let's say
that this is this specific fashion item

classification so the way to think about

934
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:10,880
classification so the way to think about
 

935
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,549
classification so the way to think about
uh the soft Max is some kind of a softer

936
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:13,559
uh the soft Max is some kind of a softer
 

937
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:15,190
uh the soft Max is some kind of a softer
version of

this block is a vector input Vector
 

947
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,510
this block is a vector input Vector
output block so it will be a soft Max of

948
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:30,520
output block so it will be a soft Max of
 

949
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,990

of using the J over here let me use the

958
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:56,640
of using the J over here let me use the
 

959
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,710
of using the J over here let me use the
small letter k

960
00:24:59,710 --> 00:24:59,720
small letter k
 

961
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:06,029

CJ so what we do um in English is to

968
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:17,320
CJ so what we do um in English is to
 

969
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,909
CJ so what we do um in English is to
just how to translate this equation in a

00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
just how to translate this equation in a
 

971
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,750
just how to translate this equation in a
kind of intuitive way we are going to

972
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
kind of intuitive way we are going to
 

973
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,190
kind of intuitive way we are going to
convert all the logic into positive

974
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,200
convert all the logic into positive
 

975
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,470
convert all the logic into positive
numbers that's basically what the

976
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:27,480
numbers that's basically what the
 

977
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,630
numbers that's basically what the
numerator is doing and we are going to

978
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:29,640
numerator is doing and we are going to
 

979
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,789
numerator is doing and we are going to
normalize them so that at the end of the

980
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:31,799

which uh is a bit different than the

1142
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,000
which uh is a bit different than the
 

1143
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,950
which uh is a bit different than the
binary cross entropy but is you know

1144
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:22,960
binary cross entropy but is you know
 

1145
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,389
binary cross entropy but is you know
almost identically in the same because

1146
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:25,399
almost identically in the same because
 

1147
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,509
almost identically in the same because
we are instead of having two class over

1148
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:27,519
we are instead of having two class over
 

1149
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,750
we are instead of having two class over
here we have

1150
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:28,760
here we have
 

1151
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,190
here we have
and having two terms in the binary

1152
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
and having two terms in the binary
 

1153
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,269
and having two terms in the binary
crossentropy loss we have 10 classes and

1154
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:34,279
crossentropy loss we have 10 classes and
 

1155
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:36,590
crossentropy loss we have 10 classes and
and therefore we have a summation of 10

1156
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:36,600
and therefore we have a summation of 10
 

1157
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,310
and therefore we have a summation of 10
terms inside this categorical cross

1158
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:39,320
terms inside this categorical cross
 

1159
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,950
terms inside this categorical cross
entropy loss function um and then of

1160
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:41,960
entropy loss function um and then of
 

1161
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,149
entropy loss function um and then of
course we are using a metric which is

1162
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:44,159
course we are using a metric which is
 

1163
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,549
course we are using a metric which is
the accuracy metric we are going to

1164
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:46,559
the accuracy metric we are going to
 

1165
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,070
the accuracy metric we are going to
train the model with the do fit API

we are uh then able to do predictions so

1180
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:10,120
we are uh then able to do predictions so
 

1181
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,789
we are uh then able to do predictions so
we're going to see some outputs uh which

1182
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:12,799
we're going to see some outputs uh which
 

1183
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,350
we're going to see some outputs uh which
evidently there will be some y hat

1184
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
evidently there will be some y hat
 

1185
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,789
evidently there will be some y hat
output that we are producing so we have

1186
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:17,799
output that we are producing so we have
 

1187
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:21,630

um uh let's say using test images we are

1188
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:21,640
um uh let's say using test images we are
 

1189
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,990
um uh let's say using test images we are
able to use to do predictions and let's

1190
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,000
able to use to do predictions and let's
 

1191
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,950
able to use to do predictions and let's
do the predictions for the first image

1192

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:32,720
set this is evidently going to produce
 

1197
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,430

an array of 10 numbers and these numbers

1198
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:35,440
an array of 10 numbers and these numbers
 

1199
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,470
an array of 10 numbers and these numbers
are the probabilities which I just drew

1200
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:38,480
are the probabilities which I just drew
 

1201
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,830
are the probabilities which I just drew
uh the in the in this kind of a

1202
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:40,840
uh the in the in this kind of a
 

1203
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,110
uh the in the in this kind of a
probability Mass function a few moments

1204
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:43,120
probability Mass function a few moments
 

1205
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,710
probability Mass function a few moments
ago and uh that's uh basically it we are

1206
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:46,720
ago and uh that's uh basically it we are
 

1207
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,909
ago and uh that's uh basically it we are
going to definitely uh use the argmax

1208
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:49,919
going to definitely uh use the argmax
 

1209
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,269
going to definitely uh use the argmax
operator to report uh the class in this

1210
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279
operator to report uh the class in this
 

1211
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,110
operator to report uh the class in this
case it is the winning class is index 9

1212
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
case it is the winning class is index 9
 

1213
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,669
case it is the winning class is index 9
and uh as you can see here we have a

1214
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
and uh as you can see here we have a
 

1215
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,669
and uh as you can see here we have a
very good situation uh we are

1216
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:02,679
very good situation uh we are
 

1217
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:04,549
very good situation uh we are
98.89%

1218
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:04,559
98.89%
 

1219
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,310
98.89%
confident uh that this is the U correct

1220
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
confident uh that this is the U correct
 

1221
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,110
confident uh that this is the U correct
class and this is uh the result of the

1222
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:12,120
class and this is uh the result of the
 

1223
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,230
class and this is uh the result of the
soft Max block as we discussed so this

1224
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:15,240
soft Max block as we discussed so this
 

1225
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,950
soft Max block as we discussed so this
is the uh I'm guessing the some uh plots

1226
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:19,960
is the uh I'm guessing the some uh plots
 

1227
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,310
is the uh I'm guessing the some uh plots
of this posterior probability there are

1228
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320
of this posterior probability there are
 

1229
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,750
of this posterior probability there are
some small probabilities around class 5

1230
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:25,760
some small probabilities around class 5
 

1231
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,350
some small probabilities around class 5
and Class 7 uh and definitely we have

1232
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,360
and Class 7 uh and definitely we have
 

1233
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,509
and Class 7 uh and definitely we have
the specific class which is angle boot

1234
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:31,519
the specific class which is angle boot
 

1235
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,870
the specific class which is angle boot
over here and we are also seeing um

1236
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:35,880
over here and we are also seeing um
 

1237
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,310
over here and we are also seeing um
mistake that the predictor actually has

1238
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:38,320
mistake that the predictor actually has
 

1239
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,750
mistake that the predictor actually has
made for another uh uh example uh I

1240
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:42,760
made for another uh uh example uh I
 

1241
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,830
made for another uh uh example uh I
believe the example here is

1242
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:45,840
believe the example here is
 

1243
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,269
believe the example here is
uh um probably some other some other

1244
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:50,279
uh um probably some other some other
 

1245
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,549
uh um probably some other some other
test image it doesn't really matter

1246
00:31:52,549 --> 00:31:52,559
test image it doesn't really matter
 

1247
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,430
test image it doesn't really matter
exactly which one uh where we have

1248
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:54,440
exactly which one uh where we have
 

1249
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,509
exactly which one uh where we have
actually reported uh that uh this is a

1250
00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:57,519
actually reported uh that uh this is a
 

1251
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,669
actually reported uh that uh this is a
sneak sneer and uh in fact uh although

1252
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,679
sneak sneer and uh in fact uh although
 

1253
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,310
sneak sneer and uh in fact uh although
it is a sneaker we reporting that this

1254
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:03,320
it is a sneaker we reporting that this
 

1255
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,269
it is a sneaker we reporting that this
is going this is a sandal okay that's

1256
00:32:06,269 --> 00:32:06,279
is going this is a sandal okay that's
 

1257
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:10,549
is going this is a sandal okay that's
the category five all right so we are

1258
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:10,559
the category five all right so we are
 

1259
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,430
the category five all right so we are
just doing exactly the same for many

1260
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:12,440
just doing exactly the same for many
 

1261
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,149
just doing exactly the same for many
images and we are concluding uh this uh

1262
00:32:16,149 --> 00:32:16,159
images and we are concluding uh this uh
 

1263
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:17,230
images and we are concluding uh this uh
this this

1264
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,240
this this
 

1265
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,870
this this
notebook um that's basically it we we

1266
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
notebook um that's basically it we we
 

1267
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,070
notebook um that's basically it we we
have uh just went through our first uh

1268
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,080
have uh just went through our first uh
 

1269
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,149

00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:30,159
connected layer years and we are going
 

1273
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,909
connected layer years and we are going
now to go U into discussing a little bit

1274
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:32,919
now to go U into discussing a little bit
 

1275
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:37,549
now to go U into discussing a little bit
on how uh the internal internals of this

1276
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:37,559
on how uh the internal internals of this
 

1277
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,789
on how uh the internal internals of this
kind of training procedure uh are

1278
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:39,799
kind of training procedure uh are
 

1279
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,870
kind of training procedure uh are
working more specifically we are going

1280
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:41,880
working more specifically we are going
 

1281
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,430
working more specifically we are going
to be concerned a little bit with the uh

1282
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:45,440
to be concerned a little bit with the uh
 

1283
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,870
to be concerned a little bit with the uh
calculation of the gradient which is um

1284
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:48,880
calculation of the gradient which is um
 

1285
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,110
calculation of the gradient which is um
present in stochastic gr descent and we

1286
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,120
present in stochastic gr descent and we
 

1287
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,310
present in stochastic gr descent and we
will look at a operation which is called

1288
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:54,320
will look at a operation which is called
 

1289
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,149
will look at a operation which is called
back propagation operation that it will

1290
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:57,159
back propagation operation that it will
 

1291
00:32:57,159 --> 00:32:59,629
back propagation operation that it will
uh calculate this gradient uh very

1292
00:32:59,629 --> 00:32:59,639
uh calculate this gradient uh very
 

1293
00:32:59,639 --> 00:33:02,960
uh calculate this gradient uh very
efficiently for us
