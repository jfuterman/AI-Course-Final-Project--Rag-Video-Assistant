00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,400
Brooklyn so let's call
 

173
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,950
Brooklyn so let's call
this uh the

174
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:38,960
this uh the
 

175
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,629
this uh the
um SB the state that I am um in Brooklyn

176
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
um SB the state that I am um in Brooklyn
 

177
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,670
um SB the state that I am um in Brooklyn
right now and uh at some point I need to

178
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:49,680
right now and uh at some point I need to
 

179
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,150
right now and uh at some point I need to
uh go back to uh New Jersey in uh and

180
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,160
uh go back to uh New Jersey in uh and
 

181
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,710
uh go back to uh New Jersey in uh and
and therefore I have two options either

182
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:55,720
and therefore I have two options either
 

183
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,629
and therefore I have two options either
to take an

184
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:57,639
to take an
 

185
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,230
to take an
action uh to go through the Brooklyn

186
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:00,240
action uh to go through the Brooklyn
 

187
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,070
action uh to go through the Brooklyn
Bridge or to take another action and go

188
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,080
Bridge or to take another action and go
 

189
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,350
Bridge or to take another action and go
through the Manhattan Bridge so that's

190
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:05,360
through the Manhattan Bridge so that's
 

191
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,710
through the Manhattan Bridge so that's
my

192
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:06,720
my
 

193
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:15,230
my
A1 and

194
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,240

 

195
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:23,189

A2 and A2 is

196
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199

 

197
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,670

Manhattan and let's also now Define two

198
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:25,680
Manhattan and let's also now Define two
 

199
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,110
Manhattan and let's also now Define two
other states the past Brooklyn and the

200
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
other states the past Brooklyn and the
 

201
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,629
other states the past Brooklyn and the
past man cut and Bridge states that I

202
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:31,639
past man cut and Bridge states that I
 

203
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,270
past man cut and Bridge states that I
end up after I kind of crossed uh those

204
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
end up after I kind of crossed uh those
 

205
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,749
end up after I kind of crossed uh those
two Bridges so just like what happens in

206
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:38,759
two Bridges so just like what happens in
 

207
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,870
two Bridges so just like what happens in
in kind of real life the moment you go

208
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:41,880
in kind of real life the moment you go
 

209
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,830
in kind of real life the moment you go
through um a kind of a significant kind

210
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:44,840
through um a kind of a significant kind
 

211
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,670
through um a kind of a significant kind
of milestone in your commute let's say

212
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
of milestone in your commute let's say
 

213
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,430
of milestone in your commute let's say
crossing a very uh too busy kind of

214
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:50,440
crossing a very uh too busy kind of
 

215
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,870
crossing a very uh too busy kind of
landmarks over here uh then you can

216
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
landmarks over here uh then you can
 

217
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,830
landmarks over here uh then you can
actually update your estimate okay now

218
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:54,840
actually update your estimate okay now
 

219
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,270
actually update your estimate okay now
that I have passed the Brooklyn Bridge

220
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:56,280
that I have passed the Brooklyn Bridge
 

221
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,950
that I have passed the Brooklyn Bridge
now I have another uh you know 40

222
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
now I have another uh you know 40
 

223
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,950
now I have another uh you know 40
minutes to reach my kind of destination

224
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:01,960
minutes to reach my kind of destination
 

225
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,629
minutes to reach my kind of destination
then uh that is this value over here uh

226
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
then uh that is this value over here uh
 

227
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,510
then uh that is this value over here uh
the fact that you uh can now update the

228
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
the fact that you uh can now update the
 

229
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,390
the fact that you uh can now update the
SB using another guess so we are

230
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,400
SB using another guess so we are
 

231
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,350
SB using another guess so we are
effectively estimating using yet another

232
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
effectively estimating using yet another
 

233
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,990
effectively estimating using yet another
estimate and this is basically what the

234
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,000
estimate and this is basically what the
 

235
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,350
estimate and this is basically what the
bootstrapping is so the um we kind of

236
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
bootstrapping is so the um we kind of
 

237
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,150
bootstrapping is so the um we kind of
receive our reward here uh which is this

238
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
receive our reward here uh which is this
 

239
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,110
receive our reward here uh which is this
the moment we uh sort of pass we

240
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:27,120
the moment we uh sort of pass we
 

241
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,150
the moment we uh sort of pass we
actually taking this action and we are

242
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,160
actually taking this action and we are
 

243
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,790
actually taking this action and we are
uh sort of of uh Landing into these S

244
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:31,800
uh sort of of uh Landing into these S
 

245
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,790
uh sort of of uh Landing into these S
Prime

246
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
Prime
 

247
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,909
Prime
States and uh we are actually using the

248
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
States and uh we are actually using the
 

249
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,950
States and uh we are actually using the
estimates of these uh States in order

250
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:37,960
estimates of these uh States in order
 

251
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,270
estimates of these uh States in order
for for us to uh bootstrap and update in

252
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,280
for for us to uh bootstrap and update in
 

253
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,670
for for us to uh bootstrap and update in
uh the estimate of the state again we're

254
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:45,680
uh the estimate of the state again we're
 

255
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,150
uh the estimate of the state again we're
doing uh one step unrolling uh here and

256
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:49,160
doing uh one step unrolling uh here and
 

257
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,309
doing uh one step unrolling uh here and
this is uh the what a diff temporal

258
00:06:52,309 --> 00:06:52,319
this is uh the what a diff temporal
 

259
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,309
this is uh the what a diff temporal
difference actually is um so that's um

260
00:06:56,309 --> 00:06:56,319
difference actually is um so that's um
 

261
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,230
difference actually is um so that's um
uh so now I think we should come to the

262
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
uh so now I think we should come to the
 

263
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,710
uh so now I think we should come to the
discussion as to

264
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
discussion as to
 

265
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,589
discussion as to
um is that temporal difference method um

266
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
um is that temporal difference method um
 

267
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,869
um is that temporal difference method um
has any other Advantage compared to

268
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:05,879
has any other Advantage compared to
 

269
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,629
has any other Advantage compared to
Monto Carlo obviously we don't have to

270
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
Monto Carlo obviously we don't have to
 

271
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,710
Monto Carlo obviously we don't have to
wait until the episode ends until uh for

272
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:11,720
wait until the episode ends until uh for
 

273
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,710
wait until the episode ends until uh for
us to update sometimes the episodes are

274
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
us to update sometimes the episodes are
 

275
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,270
us to update sometimes the episodes are
so long uh that uh you know the that's

276
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,280
so long uh that uh you know the that's
 

277
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,430
so long uh that uh you know the that's
kind of a significant Advantage

278
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
kind of a significant Advantage
 

279
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,830
kind of a significant Advantage
effectively making the temporal

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:22,840
effectively making the temporal
 

281
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,350
effectively making the temporal
difference method I will call it as part

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,950
learning uh the other uh kind of
significant difference is that um it

288
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:33,960
significant difference is that um it
 

289
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,589
significant difference is that um it
turns out that uh they do converge um

290
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:39,599
turns out that uh they do converge um
 

291
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,070
turns out that uh they do converge um
into the uh so there's not really uh any

292
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,080
into the uh so there's not really uh any
 

293
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,749
into the uh so there's not really uh any
issue of using a guess or an estimate to

difference methods are uh converging and

304
00:07:58,909 --> 00:07:58,919
difference methods are uh converging and
 

305
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,230
difference methods are uh converging and
uh in in fact depending on the setting

306
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
uh in in fact depending on the setting
 

307
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,230
uh in in fact depending on the setting
uh of uh this Alpha over there if it is

00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:05,240
uh of uh this Alpha over there if it is
 

309
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,149
uh of uh this Alpha over there if it is
kind of a small value it converges and

310
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:08,159
kind of a small value it converges and
 

311
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:10,909
kind of a small value it converges and
and everything is fine the one thing

312
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:10,919
and everything is fine the one thing
 

313
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,749
and everything is fine the one thing
that um you can actually see the

314
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:12,759
that um you can actually see the
 

315
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,790
that um you can actually see the
convergence is by running an example uh

316
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:15,800
convergence is by running an example uh
 

317
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,950
convergence is by running an example uh
in the previous video we have seen uh an

318
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:18,960
in the previous video we have seen uh an
 

319
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,149
in the previous video we have seen uh an
a mark of reward process and uh using if

320
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:23,159
a mark of reward process and uh using if
 

321
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:25,830
a mark of reward process and uh using if
you like two terminal States and I think

322
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
you like two terminal States and I think
 

323
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,390
you like two terminal States and I think
it's worthwhile going through uh that

324
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:28,400
it's worthwhile going through uh that
 

325
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,749
it's worthwhile going through uh that
example with with a temporal difference

326
00:08:30,749 --> 00:08:30,759
example with with a temporal difference
 

327
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,949
example with with a temporal difference
now and we've seen how the Carlo kind of

328
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:33,959
now and we've seen how the Carlo kind of
 

329
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:36,750
now and we've seen how the Carlo kind of
approximates the sort of True Value

330
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:36,760
approximates the sort of True Value
 

331
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,589
approximates the sort of True Value
function and I just want to show

332
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
function and I just want to show
 

333
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,750
function and I just want to show
you uh the uh sort of how the Monte

334
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:43,760

post on the formula of the return the
 

451
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,710
post on the formula of the return the
right formula is actually this one and

452
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:21,720
right formula is actually this one and
 

453
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,110
right formula is actually this one and
uh this correction was needed because

454
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,120
uh this correction was needed because

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,190
later on in reinforcement learning
uh we uh kind of discovered that this

460
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,200
uh we uh kind of discovered that this
 

461
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,389
uh we uh kind of discovered that this
was an incorrect formula so there was a

462
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
was an incorrect formula so there was a
 

463
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,990
was an incorrect formula so there was a
couple of typos here uh so that's the

464
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:37,000
couple of typos here uh so that's the
 

465
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,350
couple of typos here uh so that's the
right one so I'm going to post that uh

466
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:39,360
right one so I'm going to post that uh
 

467
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,629
right one so I'm going to post that uh
on the MTP uh section uh and we have not

468
00:11:43,629 --> 00:11:43,639
on the MTP uh section uh and we have not
 

469
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,710
on the MTP uh section uh and we have not
really used explicitly this form of that

470
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:45,720
really used explicitly this form of that
 

471
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,550
really used explicitly this form of that
formula anyway in a subsequent kind of

472
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
formula anyway in a subsequent kind of
 

473
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,629
formula anyway in a subsequent kind of
discussion so I think we should be okay

474
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:51,639
discussion so I think we should be okay
 

475
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:53,750
discussion so I think we should be okay
and this is another uh place where we

476
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
and this is another uh place where we
 

477
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,030
and this is another uh place where we
have actually had a couple of typos on

478
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,040
have actually had a couple of typos on
 

479
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,550
have actually had a couple of typos on
the return uh now when we have an

480
00:11:59,550 --> 00:11:59,560
the return uh now when we have an
 

481
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,670
the return uh now when we have an

482
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:02,680
episode capital T of duration capital T
 

483
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,790

and uh we are effectively calculating

484
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:04,800
and uh we are effectively calculating
 

485
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,990
and uh we are effectively calculating
the return starting from uh when we are

486
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
the return starting from uh when we are
 

487
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,509
the return starting from uh when we are
at State at time step t Okay so that's

488
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
at State at time step t Okay so that's
 

489
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,710
at State at time step t Okay so that's
uh that's the second uh type over there

490
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:13,720
uh that's the second uh type over there
 

491
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,949
uh that's the second uh type over there
that we uh need to be aware of and this

00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:15,959
that we uh need to be aware of and this
 

493
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:18,670
that we uh need to be aware of and this
one will actually uh carry over uh when

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:18,680

509
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,550
written as GT let me write it as uh
after end steps it will be RT + 1+ GMA

510
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:45,560
after end steps it will be RT + 1+ GMA
 

511
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,670
after end steps it will be RT + 1+ GMA
RT + 2 plus dot dot dot plus gamma to

516
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:00,920
n plus gamma n
 

517
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,910
n plus gamma n
v s of t plus n so I actually wrote also

518
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:05,920
v s of t plus n so I actually wrote also
 

519
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,910
v s of t plus n so I actually wrote also
uh and then I kind of recorded uh some

520
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
uh and then I kind of recorded uh some
 

521
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,710
uh and then I kind of recorded uh some
other um equation this equation is

522
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:12,720
other um equation this equation is
 

523
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,230
other um equation this equation is
effectively the one that kind of

524
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:14,240
effectively the one that kind of
 

525
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,230
effectively the one that kind of
summarizes how we will actually be using

526
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:17,240
summarizes how we will actually be using
 

527
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,350
summarizes how we will actually be using
the endstep return uh in the updated

528
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
the endstep return uh in the updated
 

529
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,629
the endstep return uh in the updated

530
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:25,639
equation for um the the N step uh
 

531
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,870
equation for um the the N step uh
temporal difference method and as you

532
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:27,880
temporal difference method and as you
 

533
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,269
temporal difference method and as you
can see the only thing that actually

534
00:13:29,269 --> 00:13:29,279
can see the only thing that actually
 

535
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,670
can see the only thing that actually
changes over here is that uh instead of

536
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:32,680
changes over here is that uh instead of
 

537
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,870
changes over here is that uh instead of
having this uh term which is actually we

538
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:35,880
having this uh term which is actually we
 

539
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,870
having this uh term which is actually we
call TD Target uh we have the end uh

540
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
call TD Target uh we have the end uh
 

541
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,710
call TD Target uh we have the end uh
return the endep return in its place so

542
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:43,720
return the endep return in its place so
 

543
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,710
return the endep return in its place so
the endstep return in its place for n is

544
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:45,720
the endstep return in its place for n is
 

545
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,269
the endstep return in its place for n is
equal to 1 effectively it is the RT + 1

546
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:50,279
equal to 1 effectively it is the RT + 1
 

547
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,710
equal to 1 effectively it is the RT + 1
+ gamma V St + 1 so we are back into the

548
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:54,720
+ gamma V St + 1 so we are back into the
 

549
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,110
+ gamma V St + 1 so we are back into the
TD uh zero as we'll call it we

550
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
TD uh zero as we'll call it we
 

551
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,269
TD uh zero as we'll call it we
understand exactly why the zero the

552
00:13:59,269 --> 00:13:59,279
understand exactly why the zero the
 

553
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,150
understand exactly why the zero the
Lambda is equal Z corresponds to this

554
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:01,160
Lambda is equal Z corresponds to this
 

555
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,350
Lambda is equal Z corresponds to this
case U and uh and that's basically the

556
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,360
case U and uh and that's basically the
 

557
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,350
case U and uh and that's basically the
uh sort of the the the end result of the

558
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:08,360
uh sort of the the the end result of the
 

559
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,790
uh sort of the the the end result of the
endep return so now we can actually uh

560
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:11,800
endep return so now we can actually uh
 

561
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,310
endep return so now we can actually uh
decouple uh the um estimate of the value

562
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:15,320
decouple uh the um estimate of the value
 

563
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,509
decouple uh the um estimate of the value
function and the bootstrapping actually

564
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
function and the bootstrapping actually
 

565
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,829
function and the bootstrapping actually
we do over there uh for and and the um

566
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:21,839
we do over there uh for and and the um
 

567
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,310
we do over there uh for and and the um
and and and the sort of action that we

568
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
and and and the sort of action that we
 

569
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,150
and and and the sort of action that we
are taking so we can continue take the

570
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
are taking so we can continue take the
 

571
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,509
are taking so we can continue take the
actions at every step and uh uh while we

572
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:29,519
actions at every step and uh uh while we
 

573
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,550
actions at every step and uh uh while we
will be updating after end steps uh the

574
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,560
will be updating after end steps uh the
 

575
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,550
will be updating after end steps uh the
value function okay so that's basically

576
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
value function okay so that's basically
 

577
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,949
value function okay so that's basically
that equation allows us to do so now out

578
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:36,959
that equation allows us to do so now out
 

579
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,230
that equation allows us to do so now out
of some uh studies which are not going

580
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:40,240
of some uh studies which are not going
 

581
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,990
of some uh studies which are not going
to be presented here uh but they are

582
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,000
to be presented here uh but they are
 

583
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,110
to be presented here uh but they are
definitely included in the uh Saturn's

584
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:46,120
definitely included in the uh Saturn's
 

585
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,790
definitely included in the uh Saturn's
book for those who are interested to

586
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:47,800
book for those who are interested to
 

587
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,749
book for those who are interested to
Deep dive a bit uh further they have

588
00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:50,759
Deep dive a bit uh further they have
 

589
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:54,269
Deep dive a bit uh further they have
shown that the way that the um end step

590
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:54,279
shown that the way that the um end step
 

591
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,069
shown that the way that the um end step
what is really the best end to choose

592
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:56,079
what is really the best end to choose
 

593
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,910
what is really the best end to choose
okay so it's basically uh is it the

594
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:57,920
okay so it's basically uh is it the
 

595
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,550
okay so it's basically uh is it the
hyper parameter how we are actually go

596
00:14:59,550 --> 00:14:59,560
hyper parameter how we are actually go
 

597
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,949
hyper parameter how we are actually go
about defining this hyperparameter and

598
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
about defining this hyperparameter and
 

599
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,550
about defining this hyperparameter and
what actually has been found is that uh

600
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:05,560
what actually has been found is that uh
 

601
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,189
what actually has been found is that uh
there are certain kind of trade-offs uh

602
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:08,199
there are certain kind of trade-offs uh
 

603
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:10,749
there are certain kind of trade-offs uh
uh between choosing the sort of n is

604
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:10,759
uh between choosing the sort of n is
 

605
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,910
uh between choosing the sort of n is
equal to one the one step and having

606
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:12,920
equal to one the one step and having
 

607
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,870
equal to one the one step and having
large n and as you can understand and

608
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:15,880
large n and as you can understand and
 

609
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,550
large n and as you can understand and
the algorith that we are effectively

610
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
the algorith that we are effectively
 

611
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,949
the algorith that we are effectively
concluded um out of this discussion is

612
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:20,959
concluded um out of this discussion is
 

613
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,829
concluded um out of this discussion is
just called the TD Lambda algorith which

614
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:22,839
just called the TD Lambda algorith which
 

615
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,230
just called the TD Lambda algorith which
is basically what it does is that

616
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,240
is basically what it does is that
 

617
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,150
is basically what it does is that
instead of selecting one out of the N it

618
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
instead of selecting one out of the N it
 

619
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,069
instead of selecting one out of the N it
tries to average

620
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:30,079
tries to average
 

621
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,829
tries to average
many uh returns endep returns many ends

622
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:33,839
many uh returns endep returns many ends
 

623
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,470
many uh returns endep returns many ends
in other words so the let's call it the

624
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:35,480
in other words so the let's call it the
 

625
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,230
in other words so the let's call it the
many end kind of algorith or Lambda

626
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:37,240

761
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,510

from the core side the notation kind of
makes sense because the GT from T to t +

course the key term over there is the
 

809
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,470
course the key term over there is the
capital T which is the episode length

and so what we need to do now is we go

812
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:18,559
and so what we need to do now is we go
 

813
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,830
and so what we need to do now is we go
back to the Whiteboard and start you

00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:43,470
we can see uh anything that it is um you
know why we actually came to this kind

CT course all the rewards after the
terminating state are actually zero and

00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
terminating state are actually zero and
 

927
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,950
terminating state are actually zero and
of course this means that the full

928
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:53,960
of course this means that the full
 

929
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,669
of course this means that the full
return uh is uh is basically what is uh

930
00:23:57,669 --> 00:23:57,679
return uh is uh is basically what is uh
 

931
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,110
return uh is uh is basically what is uh
what it corresponds to to to those cases

932
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:00,120
what it corresponds to to to those cases
 

933
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,789
what it corresponds to to to those cases
so that is the reason why I actually

934
00:24:01,789 --> 00:24:01,799
so that is the reason why I actually
 

935
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,190
so that is the reason why I actually
wrote from n is equal to 1 to capital T

936
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:05,200
wrote from n is equal to 1 to capital T
 

937
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,230
wrote from n is equal to 1 to capital T
minus t minus1 because this is just

938
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:08,240
minus t minus1 because this is just
 

939
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,029
minus t minus1 because this is just

before this condition gets to be
 

941
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:13,710
before this condition gets to be
